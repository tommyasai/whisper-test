00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
This week on the James Law, we're talking about the recent falling-up between elastic

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,840
and AWS around the reslicensing of elastic search and cabana.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,240
Like many of the community, we've been watching this very closely.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,640
Here's the TLDR for context.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,360
Last month, on January 21st, elastic-poseity blog posts showing their concerns.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,200
With Amazon and AWS misleading and confusing the community saying quote, they have been

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,400
doing things that we think are just not okay since 2015.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,400
And it has only gotten worse, end quote.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,120
This led them to re-licens elastic search and cabana with a dual license, a proprietary

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,440
license, and the server-side public license, also known as the SSPL.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,720
Of course, AWS responded two days later stating they are quote, stepping up for a truly

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,360
open-source elastic search end quote and shared their plans to create and maintain forks

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,040
of elastic search and cabana based on the latest ALV-2 license co-basis.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,040
There is, of course, a ton of detail and nuanced beneath the surface here, so we invited

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,040
a bunch of folks on the show today to share their perspective.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,200
You'll hear from Adam Jacob, co-founder and board member of Chef, Heather Meeker, open-source

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,800
lawyer, and the author of the SSPL license.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,480
Manish John, founder and CTO at DGRAVLabs, Paul Diggs, co-founder and CTO at Influx Data,

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,240
Vicky Bursour, open-source, and free software business strategist, and last, but not least,

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,800
the markets think this, and every day, we've developed it from Sweden.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,100
Huge thanks to our partners, Linode, Fastly, and Lunch Darkly.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:32,120
instant access to the hundred dollars in free credit, again, linode.com slash change log.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,520
What's up, welcome back, we have an awesome show today, we're here to get community

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,880
reactions around the elastic versus AWS situation in the SSPO license change of Elasticsearch

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
and Cabana.

34
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,960
Elastic relations with the SSPO, and there's a few people on this show that believe they

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,560
went about that license change the wrong way, but this is not the beginning of the story.

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,520
This conversation has been going on for a while, in fact, Adam Jacob brought the subject

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,120
of Elastic and AWS on episode 353 of this show, on that episode we talk with Adam about

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,040
the war for the soul of a resource, and the title of that episode could not have been more

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,640
prophetic to kick things off or going back to that conversation with Adam for context.

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,080
Adam is co-founder and board member of Chef, and we're talking about business models and

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
how they correlate to open source business models, and how from Adam's perspective,

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,720
the AWS's, the Azure's, and the Google class of the world, they provide a humongous marketing

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,440
funnel for open source businesses like Mongo Analystic.

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
Here's the conversation with Adam.

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,560
What's up with the business challenges commercial open source companies face?

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,720
You said earlier in the call that things are thriving now, and we see Elastic and others

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
out there thriving as well that have been in similar situations as Chef.

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Talk about the business side of things for Chef.

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,960
I think in order to really go deeper into the business, we've got to just set some ground

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,880
rules for how we think about business, so how I think about it, and how a lot of people

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,640
in the modern era software startups think about it is the smallest nutshell.

52
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,120
You can imagine that you have this funnel, and at the top of the funnel is everybody who

53
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,040
might could ever use your product, so every possible person who would ever care, so that's

54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,440
your target market.

55
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,240
The bottom of the funnel is customers, people who pay you money for the privilege, and

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,040
what you're trying to do is get people from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
funnel, right?

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,960
It's just how many people at the top can I push to the bottom, and there's a ratio there

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,080
where you want that number to be as high as possible.

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,360
You'd love to get 100% of them, you know that you want, and so you're trying to just

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,280
extract dollar bills from the top to the bottom.

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,160
There's a bunch more we could go into in terms of metrics and recurring revenue and all

63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,840
kinds of stuff, but the TLDR there is people at the top, money at the bottom.

64
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,560
With open source, we talk about it as an open source business model, but that's wrong

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,800
in the same way that DevOps isn't a job title.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,800
You can't, DevOps isn't a job title, still isn't a job title.

67
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
It never was a job title, but we lost the war, you know?

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Like there's plenty of DevOps in the world, and so the idea that that's not a thing,

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,880
it doesn't matter that I'm a patent about it, right?

70
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
The same thing's true in open source business models.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
There is no open source business model.

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
There are business models, and then there is open source, and there are two very different,

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,480
very separate things.

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,400
There is nothing unique about open source and business.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Business is business.

76
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,840
You get people from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel, you either do that

77
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,560
with the unit economics that make you money, or don't make you money, if they make you

78
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,880
money, then you can pour more dollar bills into the acquisition of people at the top of

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,120
the funnel to get to the bottom, even if that means you don't turn a net profit and

80
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,080
still be a great business because as soon as you stop burning money to acquire more stuff

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
at the top, but you make a lot of money at the bottom, right?

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,680
And so in open source, when we talk about open source business models, what we really

83
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,120
are talking about is how do I create a channel at the top of the funnel?

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,160
So people come in in multiple different ways, and we talk about those as channels.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,360
So one channel will be, I'm an open source user of your software.

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,920
I download MongoDB, I download Redis, I used it.

87
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,760
Therefore, I'm in the open source channel to the bottom of the funnel, right?

88
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,440
Another channel would be my boss, the CIO, heard about Redis and CIO magazine.

89
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Tells me, you should use Redis, right?

90
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,920
Now, I'm in a very different channel than the open source channel, right?

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,120
Now, I'm in a enterprise, or I get a cold email from a rep that says, have you heard

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,280
about Redis Labs, right?

93
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,840
That's a different channel, right?

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,600
So we have all these different channels, there's a partner channel where like maybe

95
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,600
the guy at Pimitle who was consulting on your Cloud Foundry deployment tells you that you

96
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
should use Redis.

97
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,520
That's a partner channel, right?

98
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,120
So like we have all these different channels that people come into our businesses through,

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
right?

100
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
This is true of every business.

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,640
Again, it's not unique to open source, but that open source channel is interesting

102
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,320
because it's humongous, right?

103
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,520
If you're a successful open source project, that channel is full of people, right?

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,160
Because lots of people are using this software, that's why it's successful open source

105
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,400
software.

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,720
So it kind of dwarfs the others in pure numbers, right?

107
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Just the sheer magnitude of what's possible is really high.

108
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,160
And so when we're designing and thinking about our businesses, what tends to happen is

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,360
we think about the revenue that that channel produces as belonging to us, right?

110
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,480
If I'm a chef people, I look at that channel and I go, any chef user belongs to me.

111
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,360
And if there's competition in that channel, I don't like it because it means somebody else

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,160
can compete with me to monetize the people that are at the top of the funnel, right?

113
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:49,640
So a good example here is if I'm MongoDB and I sell Atlas, which is their hosted SaaS

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:58,040
product for MongoDB and Amazon and Microsoft are both going to offer MongoDB as a service,

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,800
that competes with me to monetize the bottom of the MongoDB funnel, right?

116
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,280
I'm MongoDB, make this investment at the top of the channel.

117
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,000
I expect to return to the bottom and now they're competing with me in the bottom.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,840
And this comes back to how do you feel about that competition is the question because in

119
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,280
one point of view, you're like, well, competition sucks, right?

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm the one who put all the money into building it.

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm the one who did all of this stuff and so you look at this thing and you're like,

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,800
I deserve the money at the bottom of this channel.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,120
Well, flip that over though.

124
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,840
The value of the channel is that it's massively huge, that it's adoption.

125
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,840
The size of the number of users is why the open source channel is valuable in the first place.

126
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,240
If Amazon or Microsoft create services that sell what I sell,

127
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,680
what's the impact at the top of the channel, right?

128
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,600
What's that do to cement MongoDB as an excellent choice for users at the top of the channel,

129
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
right?

130
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,040
The answer is it jacks it up, right?

131
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,480
Like Amazon has a chef service.

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,640
They sell it for money, they do prevention, right?

133
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,480
So they sell my what used to be my proprietary software, but now my distribution.

134
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,800
You can buy it from Amazon as a service directly from Amazon we do rub sharing together.

135
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,960
Amazon runs and maintains that service.

136
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,080
I promise you that my channel got bigger, I open source channel got bigger when they did that,

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,720
right?

138
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,680
The fact that that button exists meant more people were willing to use chef than they were before,

139
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:30,920
right?

140
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,880
The pie got bigger.

141
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,280
So what's happening when the redis and the mongos of the world look at that problem is they decide

142
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,080
that the top of the funnel doesn't get bigger or that they don't care

143
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,640
about it getting bigger and instead they care about the extraction at the bottom of the funnel,

144
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:47,960
right?

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,160
So they're nervous about it.

146
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,320
They're like, oh, Amazon will out compete me.

147
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,240
They'll sell it for less, they'll be doing better features, but this, in my point of view,

148
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,040
is completely bonkers, right?

149
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,520
Amazon's never going to invest more in MongoDB than MongoDB.

150
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,000
It's insane on its face, right?

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,440
And the idea that that competition exists and it limits their ability to monetize is also,

152
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
also to me, feels false.

153
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,720
A good example is elastic.

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,480
Amazon's had an elastic service running for as long as elastic has been monetizable basically.

155
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,880
An elastic went public that whole time with Amazon as a competitor.

156
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,000
But you know what?

157
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,280
I ran elastic search.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,560
I used it as a component in my product.

159
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,480
One of the reasons is that it was a dominant standard, how did I know?

160
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Well, everybody offered elastic as a service, right?

161
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,160
It was the effective thing.

162
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,640
So that choice was easy, so I wound up being the channel.

163
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,840
So from a business point of view, they're making these decisions because

164
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,840
they believe that that's what's best for the extraction of capital, of revenue at the bottom

165
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,240
of the channel, and they're doing it at the expense of the spread at the top of the channel.

166
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,240
In your case, you've got a rev share with Amazon.

167
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,680
Is that the case with Mongo or with Redis or was that unique to Chef?

168
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,480
And would that change your outlook at all if that rev share was gone?

169
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,600
It's not the same.

170
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,400
I don't know.

171
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,320
I have certainly not privy to whatever negotiations they may have had, right?

172
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,680
I know the ones I've had.

173
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,600
You know, one of the things that Amazon or any partner or anybody who's going to run your

174
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,520
code as a service needs is the assurance that they'll always be able to provide that service to

175
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,000
their customers, right?

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,680
And, you know what's hard to do that with proprietary software?

177
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,160
Because I have no, my only hedge is the business arrangement.

178
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,880
Do you see what I mean?

179
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,840
Like, I can sign a contract that says so, but if I change the terms on my proprietary software,

180
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,600
or I build a new SKU, well, can I still run that thing as a service?

181
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,360
Or if we vibrate at it, like what's the deal?

182
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,200
So the mechanism there is really complicated.

183
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,880
And so one of the reasons that that rev share exists is because so much of those

184
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,240
assurances about what's in the open was in the open, right?

185
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,680
Even more so now.

186
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,280
That doesn't mean that that's always what Amazon will do, or even what they should,

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,920
but that's how it worked for us.

188
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,360
If it didn't exist, it wouldn't really change my point of view.

189
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,480
Because if the question is, can I, as the primary producer of the product,

190
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,280
an owner of the brand, and the reason that people attached it as things,

191
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,640
outcompete someone who is essentially selling a generic version of what I sell,

192
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,960
if I can't outcompete that person, shame on me.

193
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,640
You really can't convince me, you really can't convince a customer

194
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,440
that the best person to service their MongoDB as MongoDB is, man, if you can't,

195
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,720
like there's something fundamentally broken in the value proposition here, right?

196
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,560
And I think the truth is that they can.

197
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,160
If you look at Mongo's performance, if you look at Atlas' sales numbers,

198
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,280
it continues to go up.

199
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,560
It was going up before they changed the license, right?

200
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,960
And the reason is, it's a good product.

201
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,920
And it's a better product than the one that you receive

202
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,520
if you just turn on document DB on Azure.

203
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,600
Because it's kind of bare bones when you turn it on in Azure, right?

204
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,760
And the Atlas version has all kinds of stuff that the other one doesn't have.

205
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,120
The idea that that competition in open source,

206
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,320
where the reason you're here is because you have this massive channel,

207
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,000
it doesn't make much business sense to me that that's the conclusion we would come to.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,280
I understand how you get there, but it doesn't make much sense.

209
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,960
Isn't our disruptive products, though, not necessarily better?

210
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,040
They're usually actually worse, but they're good enough.

211
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,640
And the cost is disruptive.

212
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,280
And so in the case of an AWS version of Mongo,

213
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,320
yeah, it's not going to be as good or as maybe well supported

214
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
or have as many features as Mongo's version of Mongo,

215
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,800
but it's satisfactory and it's way cheaper.

216
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,320
So it's disruptively cheap.

217
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,880
And then you add to the fact that there's no,

218
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,000
there's no R&D, there's no development costs from Amazon's side.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,080
So you're not competing with them on features.

220
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,240
They're just free writing all the features that you're building.

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,680
Well, but here's the thing.

222
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,800
So this is where we come back to the funnel, right?

223
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,640
So like, now we're back to the business.

224
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,400
So like, sure, maybe Amazon, but this is why it's good business for Amazon

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,360
to launch your stuff as a service instead of just compete with your directly.

226
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,120
So like, you've brilliantly elucidated why they would want to launch a Mongo service

227
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,160
in the first place, right?

228
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,480
But as soon as they do that, if the top of the funnel was fixed,

229
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,880
if that created no more interest in your product than it did before,

230
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,280
then you'd be right, but it doesn't.

231
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,360
Instead, it turns out that the single largest pool of software developers on the planet

232
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,920
are the ones that use Amazon and AWS or Azure or Google.

233
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
How many of those developers are using one of those platforms?

234
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,680
And if your stuff is on all three of those platforms and it's not on the others,

235
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,480
how many eyeballs do you get that cockroach does it?

236
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,320
The answer is our ton of eyeballs, so many eyeballs.

237
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,960
And so the size of that funnel, your possible monetization gets bigger,

238
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,800
hugely bigger than it was before.

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,520
And in that moment, your ability to capture that revenue,

240
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,720
every single one of those cut rate document DB users is a potential lead

241
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,120
that's already using your product.

242
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
So all you have to do is go find them and be like,

243
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,720
yo, did you see how much better our console is,

244
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,960
how much better our operation stuff is, how you can get on a Zoom with the dude

245
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,520
that wrote that indexing feature when it's broken,

246
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I dare you to get that out of Amazon.

247
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,680
And next thing you know, city bank is like, you know,

248
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,360
Amazon looks pretty good.

249
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,920
I think those kinds of ideas, those sometimes are so

250
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,480
seem so logical, but yet not everybody thinks like that, you know.

251
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,760
So I think this is a great idea of how could you leverage the fact that

252
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,000
these platforms are so massive that they actually become your marketing channel for you.

253
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They are your marketing channel for you.

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,320
And the only thing you have to give up is that they're also going to monetize

255
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,320
some number of your customers back to open sources pump rockness, right?

256
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:51,160
Like, there's a, there's a like, that's the man vibe where like,

257
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,880
when you're saying that Amazon's a net positive for your business,

258
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,640
everybody's like, but they're the man.

259
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,400
And Amazon's going to destroy elastic search.

260
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,080
And you're like, do the elastic search is a worth $1.5 billion with a B.

261
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,880
And they're getting like that commercial where the guys like,

262
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,000
sir, you are the man.

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
Yeah, that commercial.

264
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,520
Like, exactly are we protecting here?

265
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,320
Because last time I checked, they were public and killing it.

266
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,000
Next up is Heather Meeker.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,600
Heather is a well respected open source lawyer and a specialist in open source software

268
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,120
licensing and strategy, she wrote the book open source for business

269
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,840
and it serves as a guide to open source software licensing.

270
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,880
We're talking about Heather because she's a lawyer who wrote the license.

271
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,040
The SSPO license is a result of her work with MongoDB.

272
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,200
And we wanted to understand the design and the intention of the license.

273
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,160
All right, here we go with Heather.

274
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,320
Heather, let's open up with the SSPO you were the person behind writing it.

275
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,960
Is that correct?

276
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,720
Yes, I helped MongoDB draft the license with, of course,

277
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,560
the help of Mongo legal counsel and their business team.

278
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,080
I think it's fair to say that I led the drafting of it.

279
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,840
Gotcha. And full title of it is the service side public license?

280
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,040
Yes, that's right.

281
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,760
Take us back to, I suppose, the early days of drafting it.

282
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,120
What's it intended to do?

283
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,560
What's the goal of this license?

284
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,560
SSPO was drafted in order to meet a need in a particular way.

285
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,240
So explain what I mean by that.

286
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,200
At the time, and this would have been late 2018 to early 2019,

287
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,480
many companies that were providing software under open source licenses

288
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,120
were very concerned about the use of the software by cloud services providers.

289
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,560
And what they were concerned about was that the cloud service providers were using the software

290
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:02,760
not contributing back and not participating in the development of the software.

291
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,080
So at that time, there were actually quite a few companies,

292
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,440
and most of these, by the way, were companies in what I would call the

293
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,840
flat form software space or middleware software space.

294
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,560
And they were trying to figure out what to do about that.

295
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,280
They basically went down two different routes.

296
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,600
The first route was the source available route in what we call an open core business model.

297
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,000
And that's not what SSPO is, but that's where you have a core of open source software

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,120
usually under say Apache, and then you reserve some of the upsell elements for

299
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,600
under proprietary or source available licenses.

300
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,000
That's the route that most companies went down.

301
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,600
Mongo, on the other hand, wanted to see if they could create a license that was an open source

302
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,880
license, but that managed this issue, and that's how the SSPO came about.

303
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:05,960
So they drafted the license, submitted it to open source initiative for approval as an open source

304
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,520
license, and eventually it was withdrawn after quite a bit of comment without a particular

305
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,600
ruling from OSI on whether it was appropriate for approval as an open source license.

306
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,240
What happened in that proceeding?

307
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,560
Why wouldn't, like, what were the deciding factors?

308
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,440
I guess they didn't reject it, but it was just like being debated to a certain degree,

309
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,000
and then it was drawn eventually, I assume it was withdrawn because it was not going anywhere,

310
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
or was there a different reason for withdrawing it?

311
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:46,680
It was a long and fraught debate, and the debate had to do with a number of concerns.

312
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,560
I would encourage anybody who's interested to go and read the archives of what's called

313
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:02,440
license review or license discuss, but I'll try to summarize, understanding that there were a

314
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:11,560
lot of comments, and I can't summarize them all. The first was technical commentary about

315
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,400
whether the license met the open source definition. So there is a definition of open source,

316
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,600
there's also a free software definition. One of the main tenets of that definition is that

317
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,240
the license can't have any license restrictions, so that would be source available.

318
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,800
If you say you can't use the software for this purpose, it also says that it can't discriminate

319
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,800
against users or technology, context, and so forth. I'm paraphrasing, of course.

320
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,800
So there were those aspects, and there were some comments about that aspect of the license.

321
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:55,720
There were also a lot of comments about who had drafted it, the process by which it was drafted,

322
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:03,880
and what Mongo's intent was in creating the license. So those were like meta comments,

323
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,360
not about the license itself, but about the context, and so all of those things were being discussed,

324
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,400
and if you've ever been on one of these discussion groups, you know that they get discussed

325
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:23,560
in a non-sequential format, and it can be very confusing to follow, but I'd say those were the

326
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:31,400
main things. Okay, and so do you think that, I mean, I don't know if bias is the author of the

327
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,760
SSPL? Do you believe that the SSPL represents, I guess, even the spirit of open source, if it's not

328
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,320
officially an open source license, or do you think it's something different? Well, we drafted it to

329
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,040
fit the open source definition, and as a lawyer, you know, you have to have concrete things

330
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,120
to go on, and the open source definition is what we had. I think the discussion brought out that

331
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,720
people felt that there was something beyond meeting the open source definition that needed to be

332
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,040
satisfied, and there was a great deal of debate about that. So we looked at the open source definition,

333
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:15,240
we definitely, you know, avoided license restrictions, we avoided things that were

334
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:23,080
discriminatory according to the requirements of the OSD, but all of the meta issues were things

335
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,800
that really kind of couldn't be addressed by the draft itself. There is some discrimination

336
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,880
built-in though, right? Or how does it actually, how does it work in order to stop that particular

337
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,560
problem that there was right address? So does that discriminate in the use?

338
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,280
I know we get into legalies here, but you're good at this, so help me understand.

339
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,720
I would say not discriminatory, because in a way, all copy left licenses apply

340
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,960
different conditions when you do different things. So if you use discriminatory in that way,

341
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:08,200
then GPL2 is discriminatory, because it only applies certain conditions to redistributors.

342
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,280
So that is actually fair game in copy left licensing. Okay.

343
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:20,840
SSPL applied specific conditions to use of the software. I'm paraphrasing now, but as a software,

344
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,680
software is a service to provide the same functionality of the software. And so yes,

345
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,280
there were conditions that were imposed in those situations that weren't imposed otherwise,

346
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,800
but that I think for most people isn't the meaning of discriminatory according to the OSD.

347
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,600
Discriminatory would be more like you can only use this in a particular field of use,

348
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,160
like you can use it in medical devices, but you can't use it in nuclear weapons or something like that.

349
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,120
You can use it for good, but not for evil.

350
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:03,960
Well, it's interesting that you say that because there is now a new licensing

351
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:12,120
movement, I guess called that ethical licensing movement, that actually does impose conditions

352
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:19,160
based on ethical concerns and moral concerns. And those are clearly not open source licenses,

353
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:25,800
because they actually do impose license restrictions. In other words, you can't use the

354
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,680
software for this particular purpose. I heard about this too, where I believe it was in China,

355
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,040
there was a specific license about companies that didn't adhere to work ethics where I think it

356
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,160
was like a 999 or something like that. The anti-996 license, that was actually very interesting,

357
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,960
if you'll permit me to make a comment about it. It was, first of all, a very well drafted license,

358
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:57,880
so it was professionally done. It did address labor conditions, and again, I'm paraphrasing,

359
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,600
but the license says you can't use this software if you are violating the international labor

360
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:11,240
standards. And it was intended to raise consciousness about labor practices in China.

361
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,640
But what was really interesting about that is that the license was released on GitHub,

362
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,240
and by the way, I think it may have been more a thought experiment than anything else,

363
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:31,960
but it then caused that GitHub repository to become a vehicle for people to discuss the issue.

364
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:40,920
So it became almost like a social networking initiative to raise consciousness about the issue,

365
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:48,040
rather than specifically to develop a licensed document. So I thought that was a very interesting

366
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,520
phenomenon from the point of view of what happened around the putting the license in GitHub

367
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,880
and around the development of the license.

376
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,920
you know there's so many usages of licenses and you'd mentioned the OSI approval process and how

377
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:15,080
it was contextual in terms of their Mongo's intent of the license change and the intent of the

378
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:22,680
SSPO license in general and you also mentioned the OSD and its criteria in your blog post

379
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,200
on the cost community you'd mentioned, how many of the legacy license in the OSI

380
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,120
approved long ago would probably not be approved today and then you'd mentioned that

381
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,320
the criteria for the approval has changed but the OSD has not so it seems like there's like

382
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,120
a lot of moving targets in terms of getting approved by the OSI and Jared mentioned like you know

383
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,320
in terms of this isn't an OSI approved license do you feel it is open source. It's kind of an

384
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,160
interesting perspective just that the fact that there's this OSD that's been drafted I think the

385
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:01,080
last time it changed was 2007 if I recall correctly. It was a long time ago. It basically

386
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,840
you know hasn't changed in the time that I can remember looking at it and but I think what's

387
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,160
interesting about that is that what OSI is is doing is trying to create community consensus

388
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,920
and isn't wedded to this written definition by the way I don't I say that because that's what

389
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:30,120
they say it's approval of a license does not merely require it to meet the open source definition

390
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,720
so it does rate it as an interesting question about the clarity of the criteria and the process

391
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:45,160
but you know this is a community process so those are always they are living breathing things

392
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:51,320
and they get developed as they go and people are always pushing for transparency but it can

393
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,520
never be you know perfect. The fact that this OSD document hasn't changed in a while though

394
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,000
is that a good thing or a bad thing because you might say it's a bad thing because it doesn't

395
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,280
reflect the way the modern software is developed and deployed into consumers hands and then you

396
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,640
might say it's a good thing because it's so strong it doesn't need to change the definition

397
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,920
is so strong that you know it doesn't have to change what do you think about whether it's

398
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,640
the fact that hasn't changed and so long it's a good thing or a bad thing.

399
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:25,400
Well I actually agree with you it's kind of a good thing and a bad thing it has worked pretty

400
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:32,920
well over the years and it's been remarkably robust over the years. Maybe it's time to revisit it

401
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,080
but that would also be a very long process and possibly very controversial. There are other

402
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,480
definitions by the way there's the free software definition and there's a Debian software I think

403
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,480
it's called the software contract sorry if I'm getting that wrong but those are much shorter

404
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:59,320
and less complicated so I think if it were revised it might there might be some interesting

405
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,600
possibilities to harmonize those definitions. I would say that whether the definition changes

406
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,600
or not is one question I do think that the transparency of the criteria for approval is very

407
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,480
important to the community. What's at stake for these companies and organizations?

408
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,840
Maybe they pick SSPL whether or not it's an improved license or not like what do they win or lose

409
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,920
based on that? Is it marketing value of the term? Is it goodwill? What's at stake?

410
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:40,360
SSPL is used as part of a dual licensing model and that is something that has been around for a long

411
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:48,280
time but it's not as popular as it once was so it was really pioneered by MySQL and so what they

412
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,320
did was they said here's our software it's under GPL actually they used a variant of GPL and if you

413
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:03,160
don't want to abide by the GPL requirements you can negotiate with us for a commercial license

414
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:10,280
and that's a process that sometimes called selling exceptions. So the strong copy left licenses

415
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:19,560
like GPL and then later AgPL and then finally SSPL were all used in other contexts as well but

416
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,840
as part of these dual licensing initiatives. The reason that companies adopted them in a dual

417
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,400
licensing strategy is that they were intending that people who are using the software commercially

418
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,800
would probably have to come negotiate for a license and what happened over time was that the MySQL

419
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:47,000
model which worked pretty well began to break when software moved up to the cloud because the

420
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,160
requirements of GPL only kicked in on redistribution and that wasn't happening anymore because of

421
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:04,040
cloud deployment. So then companies that were doing dual licensing models moved to AgPL when it was

422
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:13,240
released and I think that was 2007 and SSPL is I think you know a kind of a logical extension

423
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,920
from that. So that's what they're trying to do they're trying to allow people to use the software

424
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:30,280
for certain you know in a say to test it out to use it on a small scale to use it to do certain

425
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:37,240
things but to require people to come to the table when they want to do things at scale or

426
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,600
certain kind of commercial activities. Yeah because the cloud providers are user essentially right

427
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,840
I mean at that point. Yes that's actually very perceptive comment they are users they're not

428
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,520
distributors of software. Right. It's a little bit of a complicated question but I don't think

429
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:02,840
there's too much doubt about that. So what that means if you look at the GPL say it specifically

430
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:12,200
says that the license doesn't control the use of software and so that is where the issue comes

431
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:21,960
to play because the cloud providers are users and so under say GPL they don't have any you

432
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,560
know basically don't have any conditions at all. Right and it's kind of odd to say I mean sure

433
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,440
they're not distributing it out to you know individual installations but they are providing it

434
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,640
to many. So it's still one to many it's still many scenarios. So and that that seems to be where

435
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,880
the issue is that the language of the future of software the way it is is not so much especially

436
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,200
in cloud is not a distributed model. That's a single installation that means the distribution of

437
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,000
change. You're no longer sending a binary or source code to be compiled by a bunch of people

438
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,200
you're set up a service and then charging for the service it's just it's a new way of doing it

439
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,680
newer. Yeah and you know copyright law treats use and distribution a little bit differently

440
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:12,520
I think that one of the things that maybe it didn't anticipate properly was use was copying at scale

441
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:21,160
in order to deploy software for hundreds or thousands of users. That is something that is you know

442
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:28,760
relatively new so as software licensing has progressed you know certain things worked pretty well

443
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,280
when we were in a model where one person would use one copy of the software but that isn't the

444
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,320
world we live in anymore. So when it comes to the letter of the SSPL as reactions to

445
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:49,240
Mongo initially and now elastic resiliency now there have been critics there have been and this

446
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,440
is a debated thing about the topic is it open source is it open source which is I think a

447
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,520
terrible term. I keep it just hopped on the bandwagon and used it but this is the verbiage that's

448
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,040
out there. There are those who think it's a business risk this SSPL so now I'm reading from

449
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,600
Vicki Prasuerus blog you probably have read this and she says she showed it to some lawyers

450
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,880
some IP lawyers and she says by using an SSP project in your code you are agreeing that if you

451
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,120
provide an online service using that code then you will release not only that code but also the

452
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,920
code for every supporting piece of software all under the SSPL it's not a stretch to interpret the

453
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,240
wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL software therefore to release the code

454
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,240
for everything straight down to the bare metal this is one interpretation of the license itself

455
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,000
saying effectively that there's perhaps this collateral damage that might happen because of the

456
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,920
way that it's written I would just love to hear as the author of it and I'm sure you've thought

457
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,160
through these things what how do you respond to that what do you think about that statement is it

458
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:03,880
feasible is it outlandish well I do think it's an over simplification of the of the terms of the

459
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:12,200
license and don't get me wrong these kinds of provisions are very complicated to read yeah so it's

460
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:21,960
hard to reduce them to sound bites I do think on on the question of business risk this is the way

461
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:31,480
I look at it I work with many many companies to develop open source compliance policies and so

462
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,880
what companies do when they develop those policies is they have like a stop go caution list

463
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:47,400
and you would not expect even AGPL to be on a go list in fact it's usually on a stop list already

464
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:55,640
and SSPL will be there to any network copy left license meaning any license that has source code

465
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:03,560
sharing requirements when you deploy within over network those will all be on a stop list so when

466
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:13,400
you say it's a business risk well yeah but already a lot of the copy left licenses were defined as

467
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:21,480
business risks so it's it's a you know you're not this isn't blindsided you this this this concern

468
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:29,880
it's it's known for me out the house door yeah of course I mean we you would not expect people

469
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:37,160
to green light SSPL software what they would do is they would look at the license and say okay this

470
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,280
is okay with us or it's not and then they would make a decision about it so that's something that

471
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,560
users have to decide for themselves I do think that what you quoted was over stating the risk

472
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:59,160
somewhat but but you know it's not useful to get into the details of it you have to actually look

473
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:07,880
at what the license requires and it's really is focused on particular use contexts where people

474
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,320
are providing software as a service hmm I want to say thank you to Vicki for writing this post

475
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,960
because I'm going to quote one more and ask you about this but very very helpful Vicki and

476
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:25,240
not doing this call with Heather she said basically in regards to the SSPL basically it's a hostile

477
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,200
proprietary license masquerading in the open source clothing now it's getting vicious

478
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:38,520
oh I don't know what to say whether it's proprietary proprietary is not open source so you know

479
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,440
it's really the same issue I actually think if you look at the FAQs and announcements and so forth

480
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,880
for Mongoin Elastic you know they're they're pretty forthcoming so I'm not sure what they're trying

481
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:03,400
to be masqueraded they're um so I think that's you know it's it's language intended to

482
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:12,840
insight inside a uh an argument but I don't know that it's terribly meaningful in an objective way

483
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,640
yeah the primary concern with the SSPL really is section 13 right that's the that's the

484
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,160
like a lot of the concern isn't really elsewhere in it obviously it's a long license but it's

485
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,600
primarily section 13 which describes which we talked about here which is redistribution restrictions

486
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:37,720
on usage etc yeah if you were to redline it against AGPL or even GPL3 you would find that

487
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:44,520
almost all the substantive changes are in section 13 well Heather thank you so much for joining us

488
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,960
and explaining these things in ways that we could only fumble around in the dark to understand I

489
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,520
think it's been very helpful and anything else that we didn't ask you or anything about the

490
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,240
license itself or about the situation that is being discussed and debated that you want to say

491
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,880
that we haven't asked you about well I would say that I would remind people that the alternative

492
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:14,360
is probably to go to a source available license so if people you know are calling it names and so

493
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:21,640
forth you know what they should consider is that businesses are going to do what their business

494
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:29,880
strategy requires and so most companies that don't adopt something like SSPL are going to go down

495
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,200
the source available route which is definitely not open source so it's a question of whether you

496
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,040
think half a loaf is better than none I think and there are definitely different views about that

497
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:51,160
I would say the reality is that most companies are actually going to use licenses that are truly

498
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:59,960
restrictive in a way rather than SSPL so I would say anybody who is using SSPL is at least

499
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:15,160
trying to go down something like an open source route even if you don't believe it's open source

500
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,000
up next we're talking about Manish John founder and CTO at DGRAPH labs Manish came on this podcast

501
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,360
a little over two years ago on episode 322 talking about licensing and reslicensing DGRAPH so we

502
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,240
thought it'd be fitting to get him on this episode as well there we go so Manish you and DGRAPH are

503
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,280
in a somewhat similar situation to elastic you're not elastic but you're set up a lot like elastic

504
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,040
is that right that's true so elastics like sensing the way they have done it is that they have

505
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,920
their open source code code located with their proprietary code and it's all source visible except

506
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,680
the open sources under Apache if I'm not wrong and then the proprietary code is under elastic

507
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,480
and similar to DGRAPH where our open source code is Apache and our proprietary code is under

508
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,440
DGRAPH license so as a matter know where do you hear about this news and did you read both sides

509
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,000
have you read what AWS has had to say and what's happened after the relisins what's your your

510
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,480
purview I mean I think I've been hiker news right I hiker news went into flames over this and so

511
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,040
that's where I came to know I don't I know actually I did not have a chance to look at what AWS

512
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,640
actually had to say about that but I really read through the multiple blog posts that elastic

513
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,800
sort of released about what they're changing and some of the reasonings for why they're changing

514
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,680
and this is a story that's it's not the first time right this is the same story that we already had

515
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:48,520
for cow crush TB we had this story for MongoDB we have this you know across a confluent

516
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,120
and ready slabs you know this is just a series of of changes that are happening in the

517
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,000
in that open source ecosystem and you guys went through similar things as well because we even

518
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,520
have a whole show for you back in October of 2018 where we have you on the changelog there and back

519
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:14,280
again DGRAPH's tale an excellent name if you're a fan of the Hobbit like I am episode

520
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,080
322 so you've told us a story before but like I guess we don't need to rehash the entire thing

521
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,840
but this has been an area of struggle for you and in your company as well it is something of

522
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,400
you know I wouldn't say it's such a big struggle as as something like elastic wear Amazon is

523
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,760
directly sort of like you know quote-unquote attacking them right for us it's more of like

524
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:42,440
forward-thinking scenario where we you know we realize that we love open source and just like

525
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,040
Shay mentioned the founder of elastic mentioned in his blog post you know I got I got my

526
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,920
feed-dapped into open source like long time ago and really believe in it and when I was

527
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,520
starting DGRAPH I I was not inspired by any sort of business model right like I was not planning

528
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,400
out hey how would like five years from now we will make money I didn't know how to make money

529
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,200
from open source I just wanted to build open source software right and that's how we got started

530
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:14,600
so similar sort of like trajectory there in terms of like our interest towards the open source

531
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:25,320
community and so you know I mean yeah I think the open source theme is similar there so what's

532
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:33,240
happened since is that he AWS has forked both elastic search and cabana and are going to carry

533
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,440
on open source forks community forks as they're kind of being pitched as what do you think about that

534
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,800
what are they going to succeed are they going to fail there is it a real risk for elastic or no

535
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,680
they did that once before right with the elastic open distro and I think people were really concerned

536
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:56,600
about how that would pan out and remind me Elastic's share price has not decreased too much right

537
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,840
it hasn't gone into a spiral downward so I guess they're doing well right they'll probably

538
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:07,560
survive another attack from AWS but I think you know some of the criticism that I see online

539
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:16,920
about more DBs SSPL and some other companies is that you know these open source companies are

540
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,800
motivated by business and and therefore they are somehow being more realistic like more

541
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:29,880
morally they are being challenged but I feel like you know the same people then turn around and say

542
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,080
Amazon is completely okay with doing these kind of things because there's well within their

543
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:41,720
rights to do so because of the licensing put together by the open source and so the conflict

544
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:48,520
that I feel is right there right you cannot have two different moral bars one for the company who

545
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:56,920
is who is making money out of your inventions and the second for the inventor themselves right

546
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:05,240
and sometimes I just wonder right how many open source infrastructure software has Amazon

547
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:13,320
created and launched in open source right like do we then do we expect to see Dynamo DB coming out

548
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:18,200
in open source so someone else can build a business like Amazon has done with Dynamo DB that'll be

549
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,960
great right I mean they'll be great day for open source if Amazon does that but I don't think

550
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,760
they have any plan to do it because that's not how they operate and so you know it's well within

551
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,840
I think I think it's in fact I would say it's recommended for open source companies to make sure that

552
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:38,120
they are able to to to build a successful business just like Amazon is building just like everybody

553
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:46,440
else is building and so the the motivation to make money out of your inventions is completely

554
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:53,320
justified or in I would say motor grounds right mm-hmm well there's a concern too at least

555
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:01,320
based upon Shay's blog post on Elastic saying that Amazon and AWS wasn't putting back

556
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,800
into the open source bucket so to speak so from two avenues one the perspective you just share

557
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,480
which is Dynamo DB for example is an open source and that's not part of their business plan to do

558
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:19,400
that but then the concern and I suppose what led to this scenario where now is is essentially

559
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,920
AWS not playing by the community rules the license doesn't depict this and that's kind of what

560
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,720
this move is doing is like hey if you can't operate by community rules then we're going to put a

561
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,920
license that that makes it illegal for you to do things that are the way so not pitching back into

562
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,760
the open source name but then you can sort of draw some sentiment from just simply the titles of

563
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:48,200
their blog post on the AWS open source blog back in 2019 from Adrian Croft uh cockroft

564
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,680
keeping open source open open dish or for lash search which is something you mentioned

565
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,640
and then the second one is the more recent around Elasticsearch which is stepping up for a truly

566
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,960
open source Elasticsearch it's an interesting perspective you've drawn there where they haven't

567
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,480
open source certain things they have because of business reasons but then wanting to be a good

568
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,800
community player in these ways it seems I don't know what do you think it is questionable isn't

569
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,840
it it is kind of questionable and I think like you know if you look at SSPL the server side

570
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,880
public license I think from MongoDB it's actually really it's it I actually I'm still a bit

571
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:32,520
baffled that it's not approved by OSI because it to me is a fork of derivative of GPL just like

572
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,760
AGPL is which also makes GPL a bit more permissive right if you look at AGPL it's you know allows

573
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,760
you to not have to release your source code if you are using it over the network or something of

574
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,600
that sort or actually I forget exactly the details there but FSPL says that you know you don't have

575
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:57,000
to release your source code if you're not directly competing by providing the core product as a

576
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,600
service right so it's more permissive than a GPL and so I think it has all the merits I feel in

577
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:12,520
my opinion to be open source approved and and and guess if SSPL in a world where SSPL gets open

578
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,600
source approval I don't think we have any problem here right then we then then everybody has

579
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,400
already sort of like gathered around SSPL which which we could not do around the common

580
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,400
skills right I mean that was the same idea for common skills but it could not get us there but

581
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,400
already be the big name and some already we could get the industry around SSPL and then we don't

582
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,800
have a debate because it would be open source right yeah there's some details around that we had

583
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,680
a conversation with Heather Maker on this exact subject and something she had said which will be in

584
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:53,240
the same podcast is if you redlined SSPL versus AGPL the primary difference is this sort of come out

585
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,960
is essentially section 13 which describes you know if you make the functionality the program or

586
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,040
modified version available to their parties of service blah blah blah blah that's where the

587
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:09,240
changes is section 13 everything else is essentially AGPL and there is a lot of debate around the new

588
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,000
ones and the process to be approved so OSD is very clear hasn't changed in a long time OSD being the

589
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,960
open source definition that's very clear because hasn't changed and it's even derived from

590
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,640
debients existing rules on what open source definition is so there's some history there but the

591
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:33,080
criteria and the ways that you go about getting these licenses approved by OSI is a bit more

592
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:38,200
difficult and you can read the transcripts and the notes from the meetings and stuff but that

593
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:45,320
takes a very motivated user slash reader and so some of this intention that shows to sort of

594
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,800
demystifies them that stuff and maybe give you a TLDR TLD L too long to listen but you know

595
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,800
that's essentially is this criteria for getting it passed you say that the SSPL should be

596
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:04,440
or could be open source your your baffled as you said that it's not yeah yeah and it has been

597
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:08,440
approved by that yeah and to be honest like I haven't looked at the counter arguments to that right

598
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,720
then I'm sure there's there are smart people there on the side and they have some counter

599
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:20,200
arguments but from from a slightly like you know distant perspective without having to go into

600
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:26,280
the intricate details it seems very similar and maybe if it was built in 1990 is it might have

601
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:33,160
already been involved in in OSI right but I think one thing that that that we should probably take

602
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:40,600
away from elastics stuff is that the holy grail of license here leads to so if you look at

603
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,560
elastic license as well right it's it's divided into portions one is the the open source part and

604
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,440
the other one is the completely proprietary part right and so proprietary part they are not changing

605
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,320
from my understanding they're changing the open source part of the code and making it available via

606
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,400
either SSPL or the elastic license and both of them sort of in some shape or form this allow

607
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,560
building a computing service right right now a restrict cloud service providers from offering

608
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:12,200
this is quotes yeah so that says restrict cloud service providers from offering our service

609
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,240
as a service right and that's in violation of OSD6 and and they are very clear about it's not

610
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,160
it's only to third parties not for internal usage so if I am a big company and I need to build

611
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:30,360
a product I can provide it as service to my other teams in the company just not to your users

612
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:37,320
directly right it's a commercial restriction don't compete with me essentially exactly yeah right

613
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,240
because you can compete internally inside your own company yeah not make any money from it but get

614
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:46,760
great usage of the software but you can't create a competing company right against the inventor

615
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,840
yeah this goes back to what you're saying before the inventor or the user the invention

616
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:57,960
exactly yeah and they can still build a commercial product on it just not a competing service

617
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,440
right but the holy grail would be to to offer a single license right that that is that

618
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,320
that takes away hey this is proprietary part of the code and this is the quote-unquote open source

619
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,680
or similar to open source part of the code ideally what what looks like what they want to get to

620
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:20,840
is to offer a single license that can cover both their free and their paid features while being

621
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:28,280
as open as possible right and that's the that's the if that would be there like I think we would

622
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,560
jump on it immediately because we also currently have dual license which is what cockroach has

623
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,880
which is what elastic has and you know many others have but having that single license would be

624
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,160
would be the holy grail and I don't know if you wanted to talk also about BSL right which is the

625
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:55,880
MariaDB's license where they say that the initial code is going to be a proprietary but after

626
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,240
a certain amount of time three to five years it would become open source and it would become a

627
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:07,000
patchy to or something liberal which is what cockroach is doing cockroach DB is doing so

628
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,800
they're open source is which to cockroach BSL modifications likely you know that's also like

629
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,440
a great way to but I actually say the same thing right which is you know please don't compete with

630
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,640
us by providing a service which is providing a service to our core product right like

631
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,200
you know and if you think in terms of what's the core product for Amazon you know let's say

632
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,320
let's say like e-commerce is a core product and if you were to like use Amazon machines to

633
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,800
or Amazon technology to actually build a computing stuff I'm pretty sure they'll be pretty

634
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:47,640
pissed as well and so so all this comes into doing is that we have spent a lot of time and effort

635
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,400
into building and this is our main source of source of living right right let's just play

636
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,200
play nicely right otherwise we have to invent new licenses yeah they have a Kramer shared

637
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:05,880
some of the sentiment on that subject because century was licensed BDS-3 and transition to the BSL

638
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,280
and I'm paraphrasing but when I can recall from that conversation episode 371

639
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,720
realizing century was essentially David was saying I want to do whatever it takes to help me run

640
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:22,600
this commercial business but also respect open source because without the business making

641
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,600
the thing there is no thing and that's a paraphrase of yeah David's sentiment on that but that's

642
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,960
essentially what he boiled it down to was his concern in regards to transitioning away from BDS-3

643
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,160
yeah to the business the business source license which you mentioned yeah and actually if you

644
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,960
think about where that's what is happening right like you know I mean again I argued that

645
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:50,520
SSPL is very close to open source to today to the AGPL right but SSPL is not open source

646
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:56,040
so what's actually happening right now is a bunch of open source companies which truly believe in

647
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:03,240
open source are having to switch to court and court non open source licenses and that's not that's

648
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,720
not great right yeah and that's not great and the funny thing is they are all talking about the

649
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,880
same one player in the market right they're not talking about about a Google or about a Microsoft

650
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,280
or anybody else in fact in the elastic blog post they mentioned that they have played very nicely

651
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:26,120
with all the other players in the ecosystem just the just AWS right much so I have no person

652
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,000
yeah exactly I mean I have no personal thing against it less right like is we we've done earlier

653
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,200
let's be a completely fine and from what I understand they're not trying to build a dig up alternative

654
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,120
right but it is there is something there where if a bunch of companies are talking about the same

655
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:51,480
you know scored on court be a curious actor yeah I don't want to say a bad actor right

656
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,040
because exactly because he is don't know but a curious actor I think there must be something

657
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,960
there right do you think then given that we had just said that the OSI that it's in their best

658
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,640
interest for open source to help these businesses that have this concern have this trouble

659
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:16,120
to create an open source license that give them the needs they have the to sort of solve the

660
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:22,200
needs they have these problems but also adhere to the letter of open source because if you look

661
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:28,840
at the intent it seems like they're intending to respect and live within the world of open source

662
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,680
whether it's for the in quotes open source brand name that can't be trademarked because it's

663
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:42,600
not trademarkable but it certainly has a market ability to it like if you if you're masquerade as

664
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,160
faux open source is that right Jared faux open source that's right then you're not open source

665
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,760
and but there is a your file is a market ability to sing your open source for sure absolutely

666
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,160
yeah absolutely and I think you know we do open source because it allows it's it's not just a way

667
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:05,240
to to have more eyes and make sure that the product is the score is of high quality and so and so

668
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:10,680
forth but there's also it's a distribution model right it's a distribution model it's a way by

669
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,800
which you think your software could be consumed by anybody without necessarily having to pay you

670
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,680
right and again they they're not saying that if you build a commercially successful product

671
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,840
using our software pay us they're not saying that they're just saying like just don't

672
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:32,920
build a competing service against us and and also going back to the first the the the initiation

673
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:39,720
of a bunch of these open source companies it started with like one or multiple like people who

674
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,680
just believed in open source right they they just wanted to make things in open source because they

675
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:50,120
have consumed open source software they're life right so when I was like in college I was all into

676
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:55,880
Linux and I was playing with Gen2 and Ubuntu and I don't know like whatever other Linux flavor

677
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:01,000
there was out there free BSD net BSD and I just believed in open source and that was our stance

678
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:09,320
against you know windows at the time right and so I've created multiple projects some of which

679
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:14,440
actually got popular including the graph and then we have Badger and then we have Ristrano and

680
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:20,920
they are all open source because we just believe in it right um it's a bit of like a pain to to

681
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,960
have to move away from that even in theory right even in theory yeah just because of this this one

682
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:36,600
problem so Monesh clean slate start the graph over today same exact software same business pick a

683
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:49,880
license I think SSPL is looking pretty attractive SSPL is looking pretty attractive right now

684
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:55,960
and and also like just just notice one more thing right from 2010 or 2015 the world has changed

685
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,160
to be more cloud-first and on-prem later than on-prem first and cloud later approach right and so

686
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,200
if I were if I were or somebody else were to build a service today they might choose not to even

687
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,840
make it open source they might say you know what snowflake has done really well by being

688
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:19,880
completely cloud-based system and if I'm not wrong snowflake is not open source right um and so

689
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,080
so why open source right maybe that maybe that could be the question is like open source already

690
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,360
has done so problems because there is you know actor or multiple actors like causing so many

691
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:35,560
issues like why bother with all that just avoid all of that and just go completely close source

692
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,760
and you crystal build a good business out of it right and so that then it becomes just a question

693
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,160
of principle right do you still really believe in open source do you still believe that your

694
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:50,040
core should be we should be other people should be able to check it and make sure that you're

695
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:56,200
not doing anything fishy or help you find bugs or you know that kind of stuff so it becomes

696
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:06,760
a matter of principle and a matter of business it seems like this episode of the change log is brought

697
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:13,480
to you by render render is a unified platform to build and run all your apps and websites

698
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:20,200
with free SSL a global CDN private networks and audit employees from Git they handle everything

699
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,560
from simple static sites to complex applications with dozens of microservices if you're a developer

700
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:31,480
or a founder that's frustrated with AWS's complexity or roku's high costs you owe it to yourself

701
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,680
to use the $100 in free credits are giving our listeners to give render a try render is built for

702
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:42,280
modern applications and offers everything you need out of the box one click scaling zero downtime

703
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:48,920
deploys built in SSL private networking manage databases secrets and configuration management

704
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,880
persistent block storage and infrastructure as code the roku customers running production and

705
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,480
staging workloads typically see cost reductions of over 50% after switching to render here's the

706
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,040
best part we work closely with the team at render to ensure you have zero risk by giving you

707
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:09,480
$100 in free credits plus they're going to assign a world-class engineer to your account to offer

708
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,640
guidance and answer any questions you have when you're ready to transition your infrastructure they'll

709
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,560
be there to help you with that too automate your cloud hosting with render at render.com slash

713
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,640
coming up in this segment we're talking with Paul Dicks co-founder and CTO at influx data

714
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,360
Paul shares his perspective on running an open source business how influx data is innovating their

715
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:02,520
commercial offering while having a permissive MIT licensed version of influx DB Paul also shares

716
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:08,360
his thoughts on this standoff between elastic and AWS and why he's long gone Mongo and short on

717
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:14,360
elastic here we go. So Paul tell us tell us your name tell us your company and kind of your

718
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:19,800
view of the open source world where your opinion is coming from. Yeah so I'm Paul Dicks I'm the CTO

719
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:26,120
co-founder of influx data where the makers of influx DB which is an open source time series database

720
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,520
I created it in 2013 and I've been initially running the company and then as CTO

721
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,080
which I'm still doing to this day. So my experience over that time has basically been

722
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:44,840
trying to build a business around an open source software project particularly in infrastructure

723
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,840
software and in databases in particular so elastic obviously I'm very familiar with I saw it when

724
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,360
they you know we're initially becoming a company I remember the project early on some of the work

725
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,320
that they've done was you know served as inspiration to me as I was building out influx and the

726
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:07,640
various parts of our stack. Very similar software very similar business model it looks like influx

727
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:12,360
is MIT can you tell us like your license selection and how your business works around it.

728
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:18,680
Yeah so all of the open source software that we create is MIT licensed and our business model is

729
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:24,360
basically so we are essentially at this point an open core business so there's open source

730
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,280
influx DB which is MIT licensed people to do whatever the what they want with it it works essentially

731
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,440
as a single server we have a fork of the open source project that is closed source and proprietary

732
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:43,320
if you want high availability or scale out clustering of influx DB that is our commercial offering

733
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,520
right so essentially we don't put clustering features into the open source everything else

734
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,400
is fair game to go into the open source if it has to do with the single server optimizing query

735
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,320
performance API's functionality all that kind of stuff it goes into free open source so we

736
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:09,320
we launched to this as a you know managed service inside of AWS in I think it was April of 2016

737
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:17,160
we launched it as basically like on premise software product that people could buy in September of 2016

738
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:24,200
our AWS service is still running to this day essentially what that is is it's the closed source

739
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:30,200
software spun up you know a customer can come and sign up they say what size you know instances they

740
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:36,040
want how much storage how many instances we spin up the you know the closed source enterprise

741
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:43,000
version of our product on it we add monitoring and backups and stuff like that and then you know

742
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,280
that's that's the hosted version of the product the what I say on premise version is essentially

743
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,640
you buy the software from us it's an annual subscription and then you run and manage it yourself

744
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:01,000
and that's either in your own data centers but plenty of people are also doing it inside of AWS

745
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,920
GCP all that kind of stuff last year or I guess late 2019 now we launched basically

746
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:15,800
version two of our cloud product and that essentially is it's a very different kind of thing

747
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,360
because it's not just a database and it doesn't look anything like the open source software that

748
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,560
we create the API is the same but the underlying like architecture and how everything works together

749
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:32,120
is completely different and that's for version two dot o of inflex db so the model we

750
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:39,240
switch to with two dot o we essentially moved to a cloud first model so we deliver that cloud

751
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:47,000
products continuously is like a SaaS service and then over time some of those features get pulled

752
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,080
out into the open source inflex db is that because of a realization that the other way it wasn't

753
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:59,720
working well enough or it's just why did you switch to the cloud first model um mainly because

754
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,160
it has nothing to do with open source first it closed it has everything to do with software

755
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:10,760
delivery cycles so before we looked very much like an enterprise software company we'd have

756
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:15,720
anywhere from two to four feature bearing releases a year which could then you know get shipped to

757
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,600
our cloud customers and shipped to our own promise customers the problem with that is you don't get

758
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:26,120
that many cycles of iteration and each release is like super painful to do because there's

759
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:31,080
so much code wrapped up in it so I really wanted to move to a continuous delivery model so we

760
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:36,360
could get much faster feedback features out to customers quicker and the individual releases would

761
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:43,000
be much much smaller so that had to do with basically wanting to be a cloud company and deliver a cloud

762
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,760
product as opposed to deliver like a packaged on premise enterprise products how does that

763
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:53,960
trickle down to your open source then how does inflex db the open source benefit or not benefit

764
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:00,280
from this this switch uh I think the benefit is that by the time something lands in open source

765
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,800
we've already vetted the features embedded like its functionality and how it works inside our cloud

766
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:12,040
products the things with our cloud product we're able to we're able to iterate on it and release

767
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:17,560
fixes very quickly once you ship something in an open source release it's much more painful to

768
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:25,720
you know ship a fix ship an update so I think that's a benefit um the the drawback is it's less

769
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,760
I think it reduces the collaboration with the community in terms of what we're developing and

770
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:36,840
how it's getting done and all that kind of stuff it basically makes like the open source like a

771
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:43,000
downstream kind of products right yeah well it reflects the tweet you put out which is my own

772
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,680
preference is to keep open co-permissive and open and have a clear strategy as you just

773
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,840
depicted here with how that code will be used in the commercial offering so you're eating on

774
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:59,080
don't but which is good so yeah so there's what I just described is basically our 2.0 model but

775
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:05,960
actually I'm actually trying to move even beyond that over to what I call basically like

776
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:13,000
complementary software model right so we have a new project that we announced a few months ago

777
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,320
called inflex db-i-ox which is basically the new core of the database written in rust using a patch

778
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:25,000
arrow and the way that we're building this out is essentially there's the open source thing

779
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,240
and then there's another piece of software that we have this close source and as a whole the

780
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:33,400
system is designed to be two pieces of software one of which is totally open and permissive

781
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,880
permissively licensed you know you can do whatever you want with it you can compete with us that's

782
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,240
fine that's by design um and then the other piece which is the software that we're writing

783
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,960
to be able to run the open source software in our cloud offering so the reason why I say it's

784
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:53,320
complementary is because what I want is I want our cloud product to be running the open source bits

785
01:09:53,320 --> 01:10:00,120
exactly as is like exactly as the open source community experiences them because it means we'll find

786
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,560
bugs faster it also means we can have more of a collaborative effort with the community in terms

787
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,000
of making improvements because we're not like right now with our cloud 2 offering like

788
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:17,800
inflex db-2.0 open source is one project cloud 2 is totally separate now we use some of the

789
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:25,800
libraries from inflex db-2 but it's not like it's not even like a fork of the project it's literally

790
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:33,000
two separate you know projects and products and they have the they have like the same API

791
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:39,720
yeah two masters right exactly yeah with with iox instead of serving two masters what I mean

792
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:43,720
like literally you're serving two masters you have two different projects you it's very difficult

793
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:49,800
serve both easily absolutely like internally we have a separate team that works on the open source

794
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:55,800
bits versus the people working on the cloud close source cloud product right i actually the

795
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,200
benefits the open source and it seemed like the benefit of the open source was obvious but

796
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,880
that they're different because they're separate that's what it seemed like I was going to ask you

797
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,120
about that because it seems like with your cloud 2 that you mentioned you can obviously push forward

798
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,640
but it's downstream the open source is downstream and it seems like maybe you know just

799
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:19,800
disconnected basically yeah yeah it's a bit disconnected whereas like with this new model again like

800
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:25,720
my goal is so we offer it as a cloud product first that's we're not doing that yet but then later

801
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:32,120
we'll offer it as an on premise product but the idea there is that people who are adopt

802
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,600
iox and you know deploy a bunch of servers and stuff like that if they come to us and they want

803
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,800
the on premise product it's a product that they add in addition to the open source software

804
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,600
they're already running right they continue to do that it's very very different than our old

805
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:53,480
inflex dv1.x enterprise model where our enterprise product is a replacement for the open source

806
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:58,680
inflex db right i think that's a like a heavier lift and it's a bigger ask for

807
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:05,400
users to replace their open source bits like it's better i think it's better if they're able to

808
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,440
run the open source bits and continue to have that experience because one it makes the contribution

809
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:15,880
easier it makes it easier for them to consider adopting a commercial product because at that point

810
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,680
they're saying like okay i have this commercial product but it's not like i'm still using the

811
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,200
open source bits so i can still be sure that you know if the commercial relationship goes sour

812
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:31,640
or i decide i don't like want that functionality it's still good i can still continue to use the

813
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:38,520
open source bits there's nothing so interesting ramifications that i think i would love to see play out

814
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,160
as you as you go about deploying that new idea in my understanding correctly it's kind of like

815
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:51,320
the open source bits is like the core software offering and then the the proprietary stuff is like

816
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,480
like a management controller or like a deployment type of a thing like it's all the things are

817
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:01,240
that surround it that you would be offering as a service perhaps but this is as a licenseable

818
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:07,160
addition yeah that's a good way of thinking of it it's so yeah we it's basically all this code that

819
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:14,200
we have to write to offer it as a service right operations backups like deploying new versions of it

820
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:19,160
management all this kind of stuff the the other thing is we want to be able to offer that as an

821
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:25,400
home premise piece of software another way to think about this is iox represents the open source

822
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:32,200
thing represents the data plane whereas our closed source product represents the control plane

823
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,080
but the way the two interact is the control plane interacts with the data plane through its

824
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:42,840
public API and that public API it's open source so literally if somebody wanted to write

825
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,880
an open source control plane for it or if they wanted to write their own competing software

826
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,880
products they can do so and the license totally permits that yeah and the thing is like we don't

827
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:59,800
have to worry about our open source bits competing with our commercial bits because the truth is

828
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:05,640
like right there's like the the responsibilities of the two pieces of software are clearly delineated

829
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,200
so it's like there's no reason for people to put control being plain bits into the main open source

830
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:15,320
project they would have to create a separate open source project to do it which would make sense

831
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:21,480
right but that point you're kind of deciding what is control plane and what is data plane

832
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,920
and that's kind of the same concept of like what goes in core and what goes in proprietary isn't it

833
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,880
like what about backups well it could go right into our core offering but it's more of a control

834
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:36,440
plane kind of a thing so we'll put it over here it seems like you still make those decisions you

835
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:42,760
just make them in the two pieces of software further apart perhaps I view them as further apart

836
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,560
when I think of open core businesses I think of businesses where the commercial product

837
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:53,560
is a replacement for the open source products this this is not that and it's designed specifically

838
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,600
not to be that like take data stacks for instance data stacks enterprise is a replacement for

839
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:04,680
Cassandra right and now like data stacks is obviously offering it as a service called astra

840
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:12,600
that's doing well but again like that's an open core model that's yeah I think I think a good

841
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:18,200
example is like Google and Kubernetes right like Kubernetes open source Kubernetes certainly

842
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:30,040
doesn't represent the entirety of GCP and all the software that runs that but like obviously

843
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:35,720
Google has invested interest in you know driving Kubernetes forward and GCP happens to be like one of

844
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:43,240
the best places to buy Kubernetes to operate Kubernetes so what's your thoughts on the service

845
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,600
site public license in the last six move you obviously prefer this other way going about it but

846
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:54,840
you think it's a smart by them shortsighted what what you take on that so I don't think it's not

847
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:00,040
the move I would make and you know to be totally honest though like to me it's not really about a

848
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:08,680
license choice it's more about how they intend to drive innovation that drives you know commercial

849
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:15,080
value and the truth is like I own stock in MongoDB which is obviously SSPL licensed software

850
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,720
but I do not own stock in elastic nor would I buy stock in elastic right now yet I'm holding

851
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:26,040
MongoDB right even though they they're both SSPL so like from a pure you know mercenary investor

852
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,920
perspective I'm long Mongo but I'm short elastic and it has nothing to do with the license

853
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,520
I think them changing the license is more a symptom of the fact that they're getting out

854
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:43,480
innovated on their cloud offering if they had a cloud offering that was demonstrably better

855
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:49,560
than Amazon's elastic service they would continue to be able to drive revenue and drive people

856
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:56,200
to it if they're so upset because they feel like a last or sorry AWS is eating their lunch

857
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:03,400
on the hosted offering and then they you know they change their license like I mean ultimately

858
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:10,680
like they had a choice which was they either write more closed source code or they

859
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:17,720
re license their you know they they they continue right code out in the open I'm putting air quotes

860
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:25,560
around this but that code is under a different license they chose the different license path which

861
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,440
to me I think I mean personally I'm not a fan of source available licenses I think they're

862
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:42,120
disservice to the community because because then yeah yeah they are disservice to the community

863
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:48,200
because then you can say like oh community members like saw your code or whatever like it just means that

864
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:57,000
people can't start like competing projects with you without you know putting themselves at risk of being

865
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,640
you know accused of taking your code or whatever right like I prefer open code is open close code is

866
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:11,800
closed and the the thing that kind of annoys me about the whole elastic AWS standoff is both

867
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:18,120
of them are trying to you know put forth this position that they have you know more the moral high

868
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:23,160
ground there you know they have moral superiority over the other one right like Amazon saying like

869
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:28,280
oh we're protectors of open source so we're gonna launch this fork or whatever and the truth is

870
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:33,240
like even when they did open distro I called it a fork then even though they said it's not a fork

871
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:38,840
because it's like whatever a build it was all it was always obvious like when they launched that

872
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,800
that fork is what it was ultimately going to become because elastic was gonna take the stance

873
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,880
the Amazon stealing from us so we're gonna change the license a more and more of our code which is

874
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:58,520
then going to give Amazon no choice but to fork right right so Amazon's playing they they have the

875
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:02,600
moral high ground it's not true like they just they're just doing what's best for their customers

876
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:07,880
and they're sure shareholders right they're trying to optimize shareholder value and obviously like

877
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:13,160
all their customers are saying like host elastic for us and then elastic is trying to say like

878
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:17,800
oh we're doing this to protect ourselves from Amazon because they're stealing from us and the truth

879
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:23,160
is there are tons of hosting companies limited hosting elastic for a long time and if you look at

880
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:28,120
where elastic makes this money it's probably mostly from long search how many log search companies

881
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:34,520
are built on top of elastic and they just open that up right like so it's they're elastic is

882
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,560
just upset because Amazon out competed them on the hosting front whereas like other hosting providers

883
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:45,400
like compose and even and stuff like that didn't really make a dent in the elastic's top line

884
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,760
right so their claim like oh we have to do this like no you don't you could have kept the code

885
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:56,360
Apache B2 and you could have like written more and more code in your service offering that's

886
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:02,600
closed source and kept the two separate right and this is actually one of the things that I agree

887
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:08,920
with Amazon about where they said the reason they created the open distro was because elastic was

888
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,960
polluting the open source repo with code under different licenses right under the elastic license

889
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:20,120
and stuff like that and what they've done now is they've gone all in on that strategy so

890
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:26,360
basically like they want all the benefits of being an open source company you know free marketing

891
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:31,480
free adoption getting other people to talk about it use it whatever but they don't want to pay

892
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:38,200
the price the price of being really open source is that you're giving software away for free

893
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:43,160
yes you're being permitted but that also means that anybody can take your software and

894
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:49,800
compete with you which you have to be okay with like any any read anything that you can really

895
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:57,160
call platform is only a platform if the total economic activity of it outstrips that of any single

896
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:02,840
vendor right so if you claim your platform but basically you're getting all the money from it

897
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:09,080
no you're not like you're monopoly as you said in your tweets right this comes back to something

898
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,840
you were saying which in your stance for not 2.0 in terms of influx what you're doing but

899
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,080
the next version I think you call it Iox this maybe version 3 I'm not sure what you call it but

900
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:25,800
you said by design it's a permissive and you just you've designed your architecture in terms of

901
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:34,280
commercial offering to expect other competitors whereas it seems like elastic based on what you

902
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:38,840
saying others have said and even kind of what they're depicting is that they're upset that Amazon is

903
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:45,160
either lunch and it's not by design their model is not by design to be competed with right exactly

904
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:50,440
like their their hope was that they would get this massively popular project which it is elastic

905
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:57,480
is top 10 database project right like used the world over but then they want like the classic

906
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:02,920
strategy is like you spend a bunch of money to get optimized growth and then once you have scale

907
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:10,040
and a monopoly you want to start collecting monopoly rents right so now elastic can't collect

908
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,840
monopoly rents because other people are hosting elastic they're so they're trying to change the

909
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:20,040
model so they can do that but the problem is like then you're a different sort of business entirely

910
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:25,720
right like it's fine to be a closed source database company there's fauna which is new firebase

911
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:30,360
is closed like in the cloud each of the cloud providers has a handful of closed source databases

912
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:37,160
so that's a totally fine thing to do but to try and say like oh we're open source and then change

913
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:43,720
it it's just like it's kind of ridiculous we'll pull fascinating stuff thanks for sharing your

914
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:47,880
your take with us definitely want to come and have you back once you've rolled out this new what

915
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:55,000
you call complimentary model yeah some real world results to report back how it's going if it's

916
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,920
serving the needs of you and your users and the open source community the way that you hope it

917
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,720
will we'll love to have you back on the show yeah i think that's just one closing thought on that

918
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:09,400
really quick which you reminded me of which is like i think for people to think about it can

919
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,440
open permissive open source licensing survive and infrastructure software i totally think it can

920
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:20,280
but i think the people who are producing it have to think ahead of time about how they commercialize

921
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:28,040
it over the long run and for us with iox i've already defined what success looks like is

922
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:34,200
tons of competitors literally cloud providers adopting the software and competing with us

923
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:39,480
so what that which isn't gonna happen for years best case scenario right if it happens at all

924
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:45,480
but what that means is we are developing a commercial product side by side with the open product

925
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:50,440
right now so that if cloud providers decide they want to get in on the game three years from now

926
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:55,320
we've already had plenty of time to actually build a product to you know compete

927
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:01,640
hmm stay tuned for results as they come out thanks Paul really appreciate you come on the show

928
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,840
all right thanks guys

929
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,120
next we're talking with vicky brusor vicky has been in free and open source software for 30

930
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,760
years now and she's been working with startups and enterprises doing open source and free software

931
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:20,360
business strategy for quite a while we use vicky's post titled elastic search and kabana are now

932
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:25,880
business risks as a reference on the situation we even quoted her post a few times in our conversation

933
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:31,080
with Heather Meeker so naturally we had a talk with her here we go all right so here is vicky brusor

934
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:38,120
and vicky share with us first of all your position in the open source world like what your angle

935
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,760
at the conversation that we're having where you coming from um i do corporate strategy around

936
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:47,560
free and open source software so i work with startups and enterprises and various organizations

937
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,920
to help them be more successful by contributing releasing and just generally becoming a good

938
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:57,400
citizen in free and open source software communities in a way that's both good for their bottom

939
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:03,080
line and for the communities okay and you've been doing this for a while yeah i have i've been

940
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:07,800
in free and open source software for over 30 years and i've been doing this specific thing um for

941
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:13,400
yeah quite a while now awesome well we're glad we got you on the show then so you wrote a piece

942
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:18,360
called elastic search and kabana are now business risks and when you lay out the case for that

943
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,760
headline do you want to share that with our audience just the the brief synopsis of why you believe

944
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:27,880
that's the case with this service i've public license well i mean sspl i'm going to lead to the lawyers

945
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:34,040
this is a legal matter but it is not an open source license it is however being portrayed as open

946
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:39,320
which everybody is going to interpret as open source because that's just the way we speak about

947
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:44,200
things i think that in and of itself is kind of deceptive and that's a problem um but the bigger

948
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:50,760
problem is that this is a license change and uh if you are going to use something you are agreeing

949
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:59,480
to that license if you upgrade elastic search or kabana to i believe it was seven dot 11 if i recall

950
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:05,560
but if you upgrade you are tacitly or otherwise we're agreeing to this new license as as pl or

951
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:11,640
elastic license it doesn't matter you're agreeing to that you're taking on new obligations

952
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:17,160
for your company for your organization are you aware of that do you know what you're taking on

953
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,960
do you know the potential risks you might have or maybe there are benefits i don't know

954
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,760
but this is not something that you as a company can afford to ignore because it can have huge

955
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:35,000
ramifications to your code base i see so like the side swipe is a big problem the fact that so many

956
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,000
people might upgrade and unbeknownst to them they're agreement with the software that they're running

957
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,240
and the companies involved has changed is there no transparency to that change is the is it not

958
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:51,880
something that people are aware of or how does it how's it um the only transparency really is going

959
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:57,880
to be that blog posts or i guess there's like two blog posts now with the elastic finger wagging

960
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:05,480
at amazon and also screwing over their entire community and ecosystem but hey that's their strategic

961
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:12,040
decision to make they seem to think that was the right move for them um more power to them um yeah

962
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:17,560
that's really the only warning um you're otherwise not going to know as far as i know i haven't

963
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:22,760
obviously looked at the code um but it doesn't make any sense that there'd be some sort of a

964
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:28,840
new click through on elastic surgeon and kibana for instance um as you're installing them on

965
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:33,000
your server how are you going to confirm that yes i have seen that there is a new license

966
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,560
and yes i agree with this new license nobody does that not for open source software and

967
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:43,640
especially not on the server side um so it's very likely people are going to upgrade and

968
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:49,080
tacitly agree to this whether they know it or not or maybe they know about this new license

969
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:55,240
that they decide not to upgrade at all well now you're not getting security updates to this

970
01:27:55,240 --> 01:28:01,800
software to elastic search to kibana that's another potential risk to your company um maybe you're

971
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:07,720
using these things for free and a great deal of people build a lot of cool stuff on top of the elk

972
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:13,320
stack there's a reason why there's an acronym that we all know the elk stack it is that popular

973
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,720
so a lot of people are building on this and they might be building on the free version

974
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,720
um well that free version is not going to get real license and you're going to be screwed but

975
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:27,640
if you're building a company on top of this open source software and your company relies upon it

976
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,680
and you're not already paying for some sort of support either from elastic or someone else

977
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:37,880
you're also putting your company at risk in that way so there's a lot of really really important

978
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,000
strategic things that people need to be considering when they are selecting open source software

979
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,200
and you need to be remain aware of your entire free and open source software supply chain because

980
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:54,440
as we are seeing right here it can shift out from under you you can have license changes,

981
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:59,640
you can have security problems, you can have maintainers who just you know piece out and they go away

982
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:04,760
and suddenly are using something that's completely unmaintained so there's a lot of risk there for a

983
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,000
company and most companies I've worked with are completely unaware of this and it's

984
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,240
uh potentially a disaster waiting to happen I mean as we all know this is what happened with um

985
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:25,720
oh that a credit reporting thing um starts with an E. Equifax. Equifax thank you.

986
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:30,200
Now I've been saying elastic so often that's all I need to say. That's the no that's the only

987
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:36,520
E in your room. Exactly thank you guys um yeah that was Equifax was not paying attention to their

988
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:41,160
open source software supply chain you know they had a piece of software and they're

989
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:45,240
believed it may have been Apache struts or something like that that had been upgraded to fix a

990
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:50,920
security hole but they hadn't bothered to upgrade it internally because they weren't paying that much

991
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:56,040
attention then they got compromising billions of people had their private information stolen so if you

992
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:01,960
not paying attention to stuff like this not only elastic but the larger picture you are just

993
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:08,200
one bad day away from being the next Equifax and do you want to do that? Is there a right way that

994
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:14,200
elastic could have done this in terms of just forget the decision the SSPL but like let's say I just

995
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,440
want to change my license is there like a correct get like start a new project with the new

996
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:23,720
license is there like a best practices for changing a license that doesn't sweep out the rug from

997
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:30,760
people potentially um for an open source project there there's obviously many different ways

998
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:35,880
you can do it and elastic has their perspective which is going to come from a very you know corporate

999
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:40,120
perspective we're looking to make money um and then the community will be coming from a different

1000
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:46,040
perspective so it you can have different approaches but the one thing everyone should always do

1001
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:51,720
is be communicating with their community and their ecosystem this cut everyone by surprise

1002
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:58,200
that shows that elastic is not respecting the community and the people who have been contributing

1003
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:04,760
and who rely on this software so they have essentially looked at their ecosystem and said yeah we don't

1004
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:12,520
care we don't care what you're doing because all we want to do is screw over Amazon and collateral

1005
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:17,000
damage began so they should have communicated they should have told people this is going to be

1006
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:25,720
coming maybe they should have done it for instance at version 8.0 rather than version from 7.10

1007
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:32,600
to 7.11 yeah go to a major version maybe that would have been smarter um maybe cut a major version

1008
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:42,040
right there just do that maybe you could have warped it internally and start developing internally

1009
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:48,440
and then leave the open source project alone for other people to build upon and you can even

1010
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:53,320
you know push stuff upstream and pull stuff downstream you can still benefit from that

1011
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:59,960
while having your proprietary internally developed software you can still do that I mean there's lots

1012
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:04,600
of different options they could have done but the one thing they should have done and did not

1013
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:10,840
it was communicate with their ecosystem with their community they pop this on everyone and it was kind

1014
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:18,280
of rude they violated the trust of their community and that you can't really get that back at this

1015
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,040
point so you're kind of screwed the trust of your community and you've submerged your brand

1016
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:29,400
which is going to be incredibly difficult to fix it's a somewhat too elastic credit and maybe I'm

1017
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:34,680
wrong by even saying this but it seems like they've gone through a lot that when she had mentioned

1018
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:41,400
the CTO of elastic mentioned the litigation and the behind the scenes discussions I think from

1019
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:46,600
the asset it might be easy to say screwed over but the new ones there I think is they've gone

1020
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:52,760
through a lot and maybe they're in some ways quite wrong and reactionary but I'd say in some ways at

1021
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,480
least depicted by these tweets and this post maybe they went about it wrong but their intention

1022
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:03,800
was to try to fix this problem which is very difficult to fix because our permissive license

1023
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:09,160
license does allow this competition and maybe from a business standpoint they've sort of hit their

1024
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:15,640
links with being able to take that in quotes their quotes at least abuse from Amazon and they're

1025
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:23,560
just trying to tread water to some degree with the scenario I know that this is a podcast and so

1026
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:31,480
people can't see but me but picture me rolling my eyes right now okay so the trademark thing aside

1027
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:36,360
that's a different matter that lawsuit for the trademark is a separate issue if they are

1028
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:44,520
licensing as a a reaction to that then it's essentially them stamping the little princess for

1029
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:52,520
taking their ball and going home and it's a childish reaction to a trademark infringement lawsuit

1030
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:58,200
which you know I I do think that they are I mean they were totally justified in that lawsuit

1031
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:02,360
for their trademark infringement against Amazon I have absolutely no problem with that I do think

1032
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:10,280
that Amazon was rolling the dice on that one and they lost and I think they will lose in that

1033
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:16,680
particular trademark thing but I am not a lawyer so right that's just my legal advice all right

1034
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:24,600
that's just your take so but the relaxing you know if they screwed up at the very beginning

1035
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:31,560
by not understanding what a permissive license allows and what that is they they screwed that up

1036
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:37,800
they put it out there under a permissive Apache to license without thinking somebody can now build

1037
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:43,720
a better product offering on top of this very easily and if they're building a better product

1038
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:49,480
offering than we are I'm sorry folks we live in a capitalistic system that's just the way these

1039
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:56,600
things go it's your fault for releasing your intellectual property under that sort of license

1040
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:02,840
and not understanding what it's going to mean and if you did understand not taking enough measures

1041
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:09,080
to make sure that even if that does happen you can still be successful and frankly if you look

1042
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:15,640
at their numbers and their financials they are doing quite well so yeah what are they looking to do

1043
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:20,760
how are they going to looking to grab all these people who are using the Amazon ecosystem and

1044
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:27,880
move them over to elastic search and to elastic I don't think that's going to happen from a market

1045
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:33,160
perspective so I it's very difficult to see strategically why they thought this might have been a

1046
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:39,880
good move to just give their entire ecosystem the finger while trying to take a shot at Amazon it

1047
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:46,520
just it kind of seems I know amateurish and I would have expected better of a company that's been

1048
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:52,360
around for this long so let's say I was a happy elastic search user a month ago and here I am today

1049
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:57,480
and I'm like Vicki what do I do they did change the license on me I don't know what to do do you

1050
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:05,000
say what do you say to that go to the Amazon fork or I will say I don't know it depends of course I

1051
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,600
have been known to do a fair bit of consulting and so any consultant who isn't starting up with

1052
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:17,400
it depends is you know trying to sell you something all right so it totally depends what are your needs

1053
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:23,240
how much do you rely on that elastic search or on that cabana we have to remember there are two

1054
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:27,480
really big projects here that have been realized since it's not just that elastic search so

1055
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:34,520
what is the strategic value and the architectural value of that piece of software to your product

1056
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:40,120
to your company look at that first what is the niche it is filling and then well anything else

1057
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:46,040
fill it and it could be that as you evaluate this and you look at it it makes sense to just pay

1058
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:52,680
elastic for their software fine that is a valid choice and I support you doing that I want your

1059
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,960
company to be successful but you might also find that there are other alternatives you might

1060
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:04,440
there are a couple of forks now um there's as we all know the the thing that kicked all this off

1061
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:09,240
which is Amazon's open distribution for elastic search from the last time elastic search did

1062
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:15,480
something kind of goofy in their open source world um and then there's they have their new

1063
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:22,440
totally open distribution that Amazon just forked and I think there's a third one um which is from

1064
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:30,040
log z.io something like that there's at least one other uh version out there there may be others

1065
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:35,800
and maybe you don't need elastic search at all maybe you just need Lucy you know um and if you

1066
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:42,280
using kabana yeah exactly maybe Grafana would be better for you I don't know it depends upon your needs

1067
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:47,160
don't go doing something just because it's what everyone else is doing look at your needs your

1068
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:54,200
company your architecture your budgets your staffing who knows what software do you have to ramp

1069
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:58,920
up on something new there's lots of variables in there and so I can't give it one size fits all

1070
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:06,440
I'll talk about you just ask you once in the whole community could just listen to you know let's multi-caste

1071
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:10,680
oh no there is no single solution to any of this sort of stuff because every one of these

1072
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,480
companies is going to be different if they were all the same then we wouldn't need them all right

1073
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:20,280
we we'd have one market one company boom you're done but we don't have one license

1074
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:25,560
one license gosh wouldn't that be oh my gosh that would be so easy that it's so nice

1075
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:30,280
but that's what we do we wouldn't need a consultant at that point well yeah but I do corporate

1076
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:34,840
strategy it's not simply that licensing it's about so much more than that that's just a tiny

1077
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:38,280
sliver well if you want to respect your time is there anything else that you want to share that

1078
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,560
we didn't ask you any questions that like you just want to put this out there that we have an

1079
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:45,560
ask your question to at least oh no not really I think you've you've covered pretty much the

1080
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:50,760
highlights of the stuff and it'll be interesting to see what others have to say um yeah I don't

1081
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:56,760
typically listen to podcasts but maybe I'll actually listen to this one there we go well you might

1082
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:01,000
hear me thank you at least once before I think you right now for your time but uh thank you

1083
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,640
really for your time and for this blog post you shared it was very helpful for us to sort of get

1084
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:10,680
a different perspective on these concerns around open source quoted a couple of things you'd

1085
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:14,680
mentioned in your blog post in the conversation with Heather Meeker which is a part of the show too

1086
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:19,240
but thank you for your post and also today thank you for your time we appreciate it absolutely

1087
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:29,160
thanks again last up on this epic show is Marcus Stengvist who's self-described as an

1088
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:34,920
everyday web developer from Sweden let's do this please tell us who you are and your vantage point

1089
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:42,200
on the software world yeah well I I'm just a normal everyday web developer from Sweden awesome

1090
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:49,160
my name is Marcus so I work for a small company no one has heard of yes yet there you go

1091
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:56,280
yeah exactly how did you first hear about the news of elastics relaxing just curious like where do

1092
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:04,920
you get your info yeah well I read the article from elastic on hacking use so I saw that I'm posting

1093
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:11,000
like this is not okay or something in those lines awesome well we're gathering perspectives from

1094
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,760
all over the community so it's awesome to have just a regular everyday web developer here on the show

1095
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:20,680
so welcome and yeah what do you think what are your thoughts on the whole situation there's

1096
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:26,920
lots of nuance lots of ins lots of outs yeah exactly exactly yeah well I read a lot of comments and

1097
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:35,000
I read the Amazon article as well when they posted about like forking the report after they

1098
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:43,560
realized the elastic and I really don't even use elastic or Amazon website that much but I

1099
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:51,080
think I care a lot about open source in general so so I'm with you I don't use AWS I don't use

1100
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:54,840
elastic I also care a lot of open source what is it about open source that you'd like or that

1101
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:00,840
you care about and are trying to preserve or be a part of that's a good question I think it's

1102
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:09,800
the matter of fact that I can use stuff for free and like chairs with colleagues and people

1103
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:16,920
all around the world without any restrictions and no one is like can forbid me from using stuff

1104
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:23,480
which I want to use so when you first heard about the real license to the sspl what was your hot

1105
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:29,320
take what was your emotional reaction were you indifferent were you mad at elastic did it feel

1106
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:32,760
like it's no longer open source or do you still think it's still in the spirit of open source

1107
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:42,760
well I think I am actually very much on the elastic side for me okay I saw a lot of comments on

1108
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:49,080
how can you use that word like oh Amazon is all in the rights and yeah the other but they have

1109
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:55,800
they have actually done the same with MongoDB if you like two years ago I guess right where they

1110
01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:03,800
pushed them to basically real license because they simply don't want to pay I guess their fees

1111
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:15,560
I think Amazon could could be a bit more friendly towards those open source companies and

1112
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:22,840
because right now when they use the products for free and maybe they hurt the possibilities of

1113
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:28,760
future open source companies coming forward so if you were an elastic user elastic search user

1114
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:33,080
yeah I have been in the past you have been but if you were today like when you read the

1115
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:37,960
real license you would have been probably last it would not have concerned you or offended you

1116
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:45,320
or changed the way you looked at elastic search well I think it's sad that they have to do it

1117
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:53,640
that they have to realize that they feel like they need to and that's that's what made me think

1118
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:59,720
that their move is kind of okay anyway because I will still support them and I would rather use them

1119
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:07,000
than the fork created by Amazon yeah so the fork still exists under the the new fork which is

1120
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:13,000
created by Amazon and trying to carry on from that point forward I think it still exists under

1121
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:19,720
the previous license but you would continue with elastic versus the elastic search and

1122
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:27,400
component forks that are run by AWS now exactly and that's simply because I believe in their

1123
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,920
vision or I believe in their product and I think Amazon is going to have a hard time

1124
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:38,200
keeping up or maybe they won't I am not sure but time will tell on that yeah time will tell

1125
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:45,880
that of course but the same goes with MongoDB and their document to be I guess I still think

1126
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:53,560
MongoDB is a superior choice just because it's their project and their their vision so the

1127
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:59,480
so you're not an open source purest then not at all not at all more pragmatic more about free

1128
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:04,440
and open and available have you thought about any of the other licenses like the source available

1129
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,320
licenses are you cool with that and these other things like business source licensing surely these

1130
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:13,080
are things that you've read about being in the open source world are these things that you're

1131
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:18,360
also just like whatever you want to license your code as if I can use it for free and contribute

1132
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:25,000
back somehow it's cool yeah I think it's cool like every license is their own choice if you want

1133
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:33,720
to license your work in certain ways your choice and if you want to share your work with others

1134
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:42,840
that's just a possible thing and I feel in this case like Amazon is hurting the possibility to do

1135
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:50,440
that awesome anything any other thoughts no I think yeah you people that are on like Amazon side

1136
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:59,640
should maybe read the article from Frederick lord nay or something like that okay which is like

1137
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:07,720
I'm tick crunch called ABS gives open source to middle finger I think that's an article that

1138
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:13,240
sums up my views pretty well awesome hand that off to me and we'll include in the shadows for
