00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
This week on The Change Law, we're talking about the recent falling out between Elastic

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,800
and AWS around the re-licensing of Elasticsearch and Kibana.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,640
Like many in the community, we've been watching this very closely, here's the TLDR for context.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,000
Last month, on January 21, Elastic posted a blog post sharing their concerns, with Amazon

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,720
and AWS misleading and confusing the community saying, quote, they have been doing things

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,360
that we think are just not okay since 2015 and it has only gotten worse, end quote.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,040
This led them to re-license Elasticsearch and Kibana with a dual license, a proprietary

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,400
license and the server-side public license, also known as the SSPL.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,960
Of course, AWS responded two days later stating they are quote, stepping up for a truly open

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,440
source Elasticsearch, end quote, and shared their plans to create and maintain forks of

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
Elasticsearch and Kibana based on the latest ALV2 license code bases.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,040
There is, of course, a ton of detail and nuance beneath the surface here, so we invited a

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,680
bunch of folks on the show today to share their perspective.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,920
You'll hear from Adam Jacob, co-founder and board member of Chef, Heather Meeker,

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,200
open source lawyer and the author of the SSPL license, Manish John, founder and CTO at Dgraph

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,240
Labs, Paul Diggs, co-founder and CTO at Influx Data, Vicky Bresor, open source and free software

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,680
business strategist, and last but not least, Marcus Tinkvist, an everyday web developer

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
from Sweden.

What's up?

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Welcome back.

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
We have an awesome show today.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,400
We're here to get community reactions around the elastic versus AWS situation and the SSP

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,440
license change of elastic search and Kibana elastic re-license with the SSPL and there's

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,000
a few people on this show that believe they went about that license change the wrong way,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,520
but this is not the beginning of the story.

39
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,420
This conversation has been going on for a while.

40
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,960
In fact, Adam Jacob brought up the subject of elastic and AWS on episode 353 of this

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,920
show on that episode, we talked with Adam about the war for the soul of open source

42
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,560
and the title of that episode could not have been more prophetic to kick things off or

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,100
going back to that conversation with Adam for context, Adam is co-founder and board

44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,220
member of chef and we're talking about business models and how they correlate to open source

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,120
business models and how from Adam's perspective, the AWS is the azures and the Google clouds

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
of the world.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,000
They provide a humongous marketing funnel for open source businesses like Mongo and

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
elastic.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Here's the conversation with Adam.

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,520
Let's talk about the business challenges commercial open source companies face.

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,680
You said earlier in the call that things are thriving now and we see elastic and others

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,600
out there thriving as well that have been in similar situations as chef.

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Talk about the business side of things for chef.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,640
I mean, I think in order to really go deeper into business, we got to like just set some

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,120
ground rules for like how we think about business.

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,400
So like how I think about it and how I think a lot of people in the sort of modern era

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,080
of software startups think about it is, you know, in the smallest nutshell, you can imagine

58
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,440
that you have this funnel, right?

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,160
And at the top of the funnel is everybody who might, could ever use your product, right?

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,840
So every possible person who would ever care.

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,440
So that's your target market.

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,240
The bottom of the funnel is customers, people who pay you money for the privilege.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,320
And what you're trying to do is get people from the top of the funnel to the bottom of

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
the funnel, right?

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
It's just how many people at the top can I push to the bottom?

66
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
And there's a ratio there where, you know, you want that number to be as high as possible.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,960
You'd love to get a hundred percent of them, you know that you want, right?

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,320
And so you're, you're trying to just extract dollar bills from the top to the bottom.

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,440
There's a bunch more we could go into in terms of like metrics and how, you know, recurring

70
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,160
revenue and all kinds of stuff, but sort of the TLDR there is people at the top, money

71
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
at the bottom.

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,880
So with open source, there really, we talk about it as an open source business model,

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,040
but that's wrong in the same way that like DevOps isn't a job title.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,680
So like you can't, DevOps isn't a job title, still isn't a job title.

75
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,680
It never was a job title, but we lost the war, you know?

76
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,960
Like there's plenty of DevOps engineers in the world.

77
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,240
And so the idea that that's not a thing, it doesn't matter that I'm a pedant about it,

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
right?

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,920
The same thing's true in open source business models.

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,560
There is no open source business model.

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
There are business models and then there is open source and they're two very different,

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
very separate things.

83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,400
There is nothing unique about open source and business.

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Business is business.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,980
You get people from the top of the funnel to the bottom of the funnel.

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,060
You either do that with a unit economics that make you money or don't make you money.

87
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,600
If they make you money, then you can pour more dollar bills into the acquisition of

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,760
people at the top of the funnel to get to the bottom.

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,880
Even if that means you don't turn a net profit and still be a great business because as soon

90
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,560
as you stop burning money to acquire more stuff at the top, but you make a lot of money

91
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,880
at the bottom, right?

92
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,840
And so in open source, we talk about open source business models.

93
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,120
What we really are talking about is how do I create a channel at the top of the funnel?

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,160
So people come in in multiple different ways and we talk about those as channels.

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,360
So one channel will be, I'm an open source user of your software.

96
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,080
I download MongoDB, I download Redis, I used it.

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,720
Therefore I'm in the open source channel to the bottom of the funnel, right?

98
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,160
Another channel would be my boss, the CIO heard about Redis in CIO magazine, tells me

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,520
you should use Redis, right?

100
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,920
Now I'm in a very different channel than the open source channel, right?

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,080
Now I'm in an enterprise or like I get a cold email from a rep that says, have you heard

102
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,280
about Redis Labs, right?

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,800
That's a different channel, right?

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,040
So we have all these different channels.

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,340
There's a partner channel where like maybe the guy at Pivotal who was consulting on your

106
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,680
Cloud Foundry deployment tells you that you should use Redis.

107
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,520
That's a partner channel, right?

108
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,120
So like we have all these different channels that people come into our businesses through,

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
right?

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
This is true of every business.

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,640
It's again, it's not unique to open source, but that open source channel is interesting

112
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,280
because it's humongous, right?

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,520
If you're a successful open source project, that channel is full of people, right?

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,640
Because lots of people are using the software.

115
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,380
That's why it's successful open source software.

116
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,640
So it kind of dwarfs the others in pure numbers, right?

117
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,680
Just the sheer magnitude of what's possible is really high.

118
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,340
And so when we're designing and thinking about our businesses, what tends to happen is we

119
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,400
think about the revenue that that channel produces as belonging to us, right?

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,040
If I'm the chef people, I look at that channel and I go, any chef user belongs to me.

121
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,080
And if there's competition in that channel, I don't like it because it means somebody

122
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,120
else can compete with me to monetize the people that are at the top of the funnel, right?

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:49,560
So a good example here is if I'm a MongoDB and I sell Atlas, which is their hosted SaaS

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:58,040
product for MongoDB, and Amazon and Microsoft are both going to offer MongoDB as a service,

125
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,760
that competes with me to monetize the bottom of the MongoDB funnel, right?

126
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,240
I'm MongoDB, make this investment at the top of the channel.

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,800
I expect a return at the bottom and now they're competing with me in the bottom.

128
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,160
And this comes back to, you know, how do you feel about that competition is the question.

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,280
Because in one point of view, you're like, well, competition sucks, right?

130
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm the one who put all the money into building it.

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,200
I'm the one who did all of this stuff.

132
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,560
And so you look at this thing and you're like, I deserve the money at the bottom of this

133
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
channel.

134
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Well, flip that over though.

135
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,000
The value of the channel is that it's massively huge, that it's adoption, it's the size of

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,080
the number of users is why the open source channel was valuable in the first place.

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:53,120
If Amazon or Microsoft create services that sell what I sell, what's the impact at the

138
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
top of the channel, right?

139
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,080
What's that do to cement MongoDB as an excellent choice for users at the top of the channel,

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
right?

141
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,400
The answer is it jacks it up, right?

142
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,800
Like Amazon has a Chef service, they sell it for money, they do rev-option, right?

143
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,720
So they sell what used to be my proprietary software, but now my distribution.

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,320
You can buy it from Amazon as a service directly from Amazon, we do rev sharing together, Amazon

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
runs and maintains that service.

146
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,520
I promise you that my channel got bigger, my open source channel got bigger when they

147
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
did that, right?

148
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,920
The fact that that button exists meant more people were willing to use Chef than they

149
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
were before, right?

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,600
The pie got bigger.

151
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,720
So what's happening when the Redis and the Mongos of the world look at that problem is

152
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,520
they decide that the top of the funnel doesn't get bigger or that they don't care about it

153
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
getting bigger.

154
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,080
And instead they care about the extraction at the bottom of the funnel, right?

155
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,720
So they're nervous about it, they're like, oh, Amazon will outcompete me, they'll sell

156
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,400
it for less, they'll bring better features.

157
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,520
But this, in my point of view, is completely bonkers, right?

158
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Amazon's never going to invest more in MongoDB than MongoDB.

159
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,480
It's insane on its face, right?

160
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,680
And the idea that that competition exists and it limits their ability to monetize is

161
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,120
also, also to me feels false.

162
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,240
A good example is Elastic.

163
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Amazon's had an Elastic service running for as long as Elastic has been monetizable, basically.

164
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,140
And Elastic went public that whole time with Amazon as a competitor, but you know what?

165
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,880
I've ran Elasticsearch.

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,840
I use it as a component in my product.

167
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,440
One of the reasons is that it was a dominant standard.

168
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
How did I know?

169
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,460
Well, everybody offered Elastic as a service, right?

170
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,300
It was the de facto thing.

171
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,360
So that choice was easy.

172
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,480
So I wound up in your channel.

173
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,720
So from a business point of view, they're making these decisions because they believe

174
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,040
that that's what's best for the extraction of capital, of revenue at the bottom of the

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
channel.

176
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,360
And they're doing it at the expense of the spread at the top of the channel.

177
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,400
In your case, you got a rev share with Amazon.

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,920
Is that the case with Mongo or with Redis, or was that unique to Chef?

179
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,720
And would that change your outlook at all if that rev share was gone?

180
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
It's not the same.

181
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
I don't know.

182
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,520
I certainly am not privy to whatever negotiations they may have had, right?

183
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,960
I know the ones I had.

184
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,580
You know, one of the things that Amazon or any partner, anybody who's going to run your

185
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,500
code as a service needs is the assurance that they'll always be able to provide that service

186
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,440
to their customers, right?

187
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,960
And you know what's hard to do that with?

188
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,240
Proprietary software.

189
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,840
Because I have no, my only hedge is the business arrangement.

190
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,120
Do you see what I mean?

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,920
Like I can sign a contract that says so, but if I change the terms on my proprietary software

192
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,680
or I build a new SKU, well, can I still run that thing as a service or if we bifurcated

193
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
it?

194
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
Like what's the deal?

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
So the mechanism there is really complicated.

196
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,520
So one of the reasons that that rev share exists is because so much of those assurances

197
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,560
about what's in the open was in the open, right?

198
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Even more so now.

199
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,360
That doesn't mean that that's always what Amazon will do or even what they should, but

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,080
that's how it worked for us.

201
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,880
If it didn't exist, it wouldn't really change my point of view.

202
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,680
Because if the question is, can I as the primary producer of the product and owner of the brand

203
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,860
and the reason that people attached to those things outcompete someone who is essentially

204
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,740
selling a generic version of what I sell, if I can't outcompete that person, shame on

205
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
me.

206
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,720
Like, you really can't convince me, you really can't convince a customer that the best person

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,540
to service their MongoDB is MongoDB, because man, if you can't, like there's something

208
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,240
fundamentally broken in the value proposition here, right?

209
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,560
And I think the truth is that they can, if you look at Mongo's performance, if you look

210
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,460
at Atlas's sales numbers, it continues to go up.

211
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,800
It was going up before they changed the license, right?

212
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,280
And the reason is it's a good product and it's a better product than the one that you

213
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,460
receive if you just turn on DocumentDB on Azure.

214
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,960
Because it's kind of bare bones when you turn it on in Azure, right?

215
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,960
And the Atlas version has all kinds of stuff that the other one doesn't have.

216
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,040
The idea that that competition in open source, where the reason you're here is because you

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,680
have this massive channel, it doesn't make much business sense to me that that's the

218
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,080
conclusion we would come to.

219
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,960
I understand how you get there, but it doesn't make much sense.

220
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,360
And our disruptive products, though, not necessarily better, they're usually actually worse, but

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,880
they're good enough and the cost is disruptive.

222
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,640
And so in the case of an AWS version of Mongo, yeah, it's not going to be as good or as maybe

223
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,920
well supported or have as many features as Mongo's version of Mongo, but it's satisfactory

224
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,680
and it's way cheaper, so it's disruptively cheap.

225
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,240
And then you add to the fact that there's no R&D, there's no development costs from

226
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
Amazon's side, so you're not competing with them on features.

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,040
You're just free riding all the features that you're building.

228
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,880
Well, but here's the thing.

229
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,040
So this is where we come back to the funnel, right?

230
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,840
So like now we're back to the business.

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,960
So like, sure, maybe Amazon, but this is why it's good business for Amazon to launch your

232
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,600
stuff as a service instead of just compete with you directly.

233
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,360
So like you brilliantly elucidated why they would want to launch a Mongo service in the

234
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
first place, right?

235
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,200
But as soon as they do that, if the top of the funnel was fixed, if that created no more

236
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,360
interest in your product than it did before, then you'd be right.

237
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
But it doesn't.

238
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,400
Instead, it turns out that the single largest pool of software developers on the planet

239
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,160
are the ones that use Amazon and AWS or Azure or Google.

240
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,560
How many of those developers are using one of those platforms?

241
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,920
And if your stuff is on all three of those platforms and it's not on the others, how

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,640
many eyeballs do you get that Cockroach doesn't?

243
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,500
The answer is a ton of eyeballs, so many eyeballs.

244
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,000
And so the size of that funnel, your possible monetization gets bigger, hugely bigger than

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
it was before.

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,160
And in that moment, your ability to capture that revenue, every single one of those cut

247
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,800
rate document DB users is a potential lead that's already using your product.

248
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,880
So all you have to do is go find them and be like, yo, did you see how much better our

249
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
console is?

250
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,900
How much better our operation stuff is?

251
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,580
How you can get on a Zoom with a dude that wrote that indexing feature when it's broken?

252
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,760
I dare you to get that out of Amazon.

253
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,440
And next thing you know, Citibank is like, you know, Atlas looks pretty good.

254
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,900
I think those kinds of ideas, though, sometimes are so seem so logical, but yet not everybody

255
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,940
thinks like that, you know, so I think it's a great idea of how could you leverage the

256
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,560
fact that these platforms are so massive that they actually become your marketing channel

257
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
for you?

258
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,000
They are your marketing channel for you.

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,320
And the only the only thing you have to give up is that they're also going to monetize

260
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,560
some number of your customers back to open sources, punk rockiness, right?

261
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,520
Like there's a there's a like that's the man vibe where like when you're saying that Amazon's

262
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,640
a net positive for your business, everybody's like, but they're the man and Amazon's going

263
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,660
to destroy Elasticsearch.

264
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,760
And you're like, dude, Elasticsearch is worth one point five million dollars with a B.

265
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,120
And they're getting like that commercial where the guy's like, sir, you are the man.

266
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Yeah, that commercial.

267
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,480
Like, who exactly are we protecting here?

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:25,840
Because last time I checked, they were public and killing it.

269
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,120
Next up is Heather Meeker.

270
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Heather is a well respected open source lawyer and a specialist in open source software licensing

271
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
and strategy.

272
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,440
She wrote the book Open Source for Business and it serves as a guide to open source software

273
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
licensing.

274
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,040
We're talking to Heather because she's a lawyer who wrote the license.

275
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,200
The SSPL license is a result of her work with MongoDB and we wanted to understand the design

276
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,720
and the intention of the license.

277
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
All right.

278
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,120
Here we go with Heather.

279
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,600
Heather, let's open up with the SSPL.

280
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,480
You were the person behind writing it.

281
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Is that correct?

282
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Yes.

283
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:08,120
I helped MongoDB draft the license with, of course, the help of Mongo legal counsel and

284
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,640
their business team.

285
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,400
I think it's fair to say that I led the drafting of it.

286
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Gotcha.

287
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
And full title of it is the service side public license.

288
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,300
Yes, that's right.

289
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,040
Take us back to, I suppose, the early days of drafting it.

290
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,400
What's it intended to do?

291
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
What's the goal of this license?

292
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,840
SSPL was drafted in order to meet a need in a particular way.

293
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,120
So I'll explain what I mean by that.

294
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,760
At the time, and this would have been late 2018 to early 2019, many companies that were

295
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,080
providing software under open source licenses were very concerned about the use of the software

296
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,520
by cloud services providers.

297
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,880
And what they were concerned about was that the cloud service providers were using the

298
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,960
software, not contributing back, and not participating in the development of the software.

299
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,340
So at that time, there were actually quite a few companies.

300
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,460
And most of these, by the way, were companies in what I would call the platform software

301
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,040
space or middleware software space.

302
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,700
And they were trying to figure out what to do about that.

303
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,440
They basically went down two different routes.

304
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,700
The first route was the source available route in what we call an open core business model.

305
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,520
And that's not what SSPL is.

306
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,240
But that's where you have a core of open source software, usually under, say, Apache.

307
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,900
And then you reserve some of the upsell elements under proprietary or source available licenses.

308
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,400
That's the route that most companies went down.

309
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Mongo, on the other hand, wanted to see if they could create a license that was an open

310
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,880
source license, but that managed this issue.

311
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
And that's how the SSPL came about.

312
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,960
So they drafted the license, submitted it to open source initiative for approval as

313
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,600
an open source license.

314
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,960
And eventually, it was withdrawn after quite a bit of comment without a particular ruling

315
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,920
from OSI on whether it was appropriate for approval as an open source license.

316
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,840
What happened in that proceeding?

317
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Why wouldn't...

318
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,560
What were the deciding factors?

319
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,720
I guess they didn't reject it, but it was just being debated to a certain degree and

320
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
then withdrawn eventually.

321
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,900
I assume it was withdrawn because it was not going anywhere.

322
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,240
Or was there a different reason for withdrawing it?

323
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,880
It was a long and fraught debate.

324
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,600
And the debate had to do with a number of concerns.

325
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,520
I would encourage anybody who's interested to go and read the archives of what's called

326
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,280
license review or license discuss.

327
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,120
But I'll try to summarize, understanding that there were a lot of comments, and I can't

328
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,680
summarize them all.

329
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:15,320
The first was technical commentary about whether the license met the open source definition.

330
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,680
So there is a definition of open source.

331
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,560
There's also a free software definition.

332
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,760
One of the main tenets of that definition is that the license can't have any license

333
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,980
restrictions.

334
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,500
So that would be source available if you say you can't use the software for this purpose.

335
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,320
It also says that it can't discriminate against users or technology contexts and so forth.

336
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm paraphrasing, of course.

337
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,060
So there were those aspects, and there were some comments about that aspect of the license.

338
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,280
There were also a lot of comments about who had drafted it, the process by which it was

339
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,340
drafted, and what Mongo's intent was in creating the license.

340
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,920
So those were like meta comments, not about the license itself, but about the context.

341
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,720
And so all of those things were being discussed.

342
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,600
And if you've ever been on one of these discussion groups, you know that they get discussed in

343
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,360
a non-sequential format.

344
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,600
And it can be very confusing to follow, but I'd say those were the main themes.

345
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Okay, and so do you think that, I mean, I don't know if bias is right, as the author

346
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,840
of the SSPL, do you believe that the SSPL represents, I guess, even the spirit of open

347
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,560
source if it's not officially an open source license, or do you think it's something different?

348
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,680
Well, we drafted it to fit the open source definition.

349
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,720
And as a lawyer, you know, you have to have concrete things to go on, and the open source

350
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
definition is what we had.

351
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,680
I think the discussion brought out that people felt that there was something beyond meeting

352
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,840
the open source definition that needed to be satisfied, and there was a great deal of

353
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,240
debate about that.

354
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,280
So we looked at the open source definition, we definitely avoided license restrictions,

355
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:20,760
we avoided things that were discriminatory according to the requirements of the OSD.

356
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,520
But all of the meta issues were things that really kind of couldn't be addressed by the

357
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,280
draft itself.

358
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,880
There is some discrimination built in though, right?

359
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:39,320
Or how does it actually, how does it work in order to stop that particular problem that

360
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
they're trying to address?

361
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,960
Isn't that discriminating the use?

362
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,480
I know we get into legalese here, but you're good at this.

363
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
So help me understand.

364
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,120
I would say not discriminatory because in a way, all copyleft licenses apply different

365
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,440
conditions when you do different things.

366
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:05,100
So if you use discriminatory in that way, then GPL 2 is discriminatory because it only

367
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,420
applies certain conditions to redistributors.

368
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,520
So that is actually fair game in copyleft licensing.

369
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:20,160
So SSPL applied specific conditions to use of the software, I'm paraphrasing now, but

370
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,200
as a software, software as a service to provide the same functionality of the software.

371
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,520
And so yes, there were conditions that were imposed in those situations that weren't imposed

372
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,600
otherwise, but that I think for most people isn't the meaning of discriminatory according

373
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,680
to the OSD.

374
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:47,000
contemporary would be more like you can only use this in a particular field of use, like

375
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,800
you can use it in medical devices, but you can't use it in nuclear weapons or something

376
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
like that.

377
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Mm-hmm.

378
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,640
You can use it for good, but not for evil.

379
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:06,320
Well, it's interesting that you say that because there is now a new licensing movement, I guess

380
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,400
called the ethical licensing movement that actually does impose conditions based on ethical

381
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,240
concerns and moral concerns.

382
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:24,160
And those are clearly not open source licenses because they actually do impose license restrictions.

383
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,160
In other words, you can't use the software for this particular purpose.

384
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,840
I heard about this too, where I believe it was in China, there was a specific license

385
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,760
about companies that didn't adhere to work ethics, where I think it was like a 999 or

386
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
something like that.

387
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,400
The anti 996 license.

388
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,140
That was actually very interesting if you'll permit me to make a comment about it.

389
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,200
It was first of all, a very well drafted license.

390
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,480
So it was professionally done.

391
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,160
It did address labor conditions and again, I'm paraphrasing, but the license says you

392
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,960
can't use this software if you are violating the international labor standards.

393
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,400
And it was intended to raise consciousness about labor practices in China.

394
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,840
But what was really interesting about that is that the license was released on GitHub.

395
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,200
And by the way, I think it may have been more a thought experiment than anything else, but

396
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:32,200
it then caused that GitHub repository to become a vehicle for people to discuss the issue.

397
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:40,480
So it became almost like a social networking initiative to raise consciousness about the

398
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,540
issue rather than specifically to develop a license document.

399
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:53,200
So I thought that was a very interesting phenomenon from the point of view of what happened around

400
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:05,400
getting the license in GitHub and around the development of the license.

401
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,440

412
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:07,520
It's interesting how there's so many usages of licenses and you mentioned the OSI approval

413
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,280
process and how it was contextual in terms of their Mongo's intent of the license change

414
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,880
and the intent of the SSPL license in general.

415
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,040
And you also mentioned, you know, the OSD and its criteria in your blog post on the

416
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
cause community.

417
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,520
You mentioned how many of the legacy license in the OSI approved long ago would probably

418
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,840
not be approved today and then you mentioned that the criteria for the approval has changed

419
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
but the OSD has not.

420
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,320
So it seems like there's like a lot of moving targets in terms of getting approved by the

421
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,860
OSI and Jared mentioned like, you know, in terms of this isn't an OSI approved license,

422
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,040
do you feel it is open source?

423
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,480
It's kind of an interesting perspective just that the fact that there's this OSD that's

424
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
been drafted.

425
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,080
I think the last time it changed was 2007 if I recall correctly, but it's been a while

426
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
back.

427
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,520
It was a long time ago.

428
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:08,360
It basically, you know, hasn't changed in the time that I can remember looking at it.

429
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,760
But I think what's interesting about that is that what OSI is doing is trying to create

430
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,560
community consensus and isn't wedded to this written definition.

431
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,320
By the way, I say that because that's what they say.

432
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,960
The approval of a license does not merely require it to meet the open source definition.

433
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,120
So it does raise an interesting question about the clarity of the criteria and the process,

434
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,740
but you know, this is a community process.

435
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:48,560
So those are always, they are living, breathing things and they get developed as they go and

436
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,600
people are always pushing for transparency, but it can never be, you know, perfect.

437
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,360
The fact that this OSD document hasn't changed in a while though, is that a good thing or

438
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
a bad thing?

439
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,800
Because you might say it's a bad thing because it doesn't reflect the way that modern software

440
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,200
is developed and deployed into consumers' hands.

441
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,040
And then you might say it's a good thing because it's so strong it doesn't need to change.

442
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,920
The definition is so strong that, you know, it doesn't have to change.

443
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,640
What do you think about whether it's the fact that it hasn't changed in so long that's a

444
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,760
good thing or a bad thing?

445
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,640
Well, I actually agree with you it is kind of a good thing and a bad thing.

446
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,200
It has worked pretty well over the years and it's been remarkably robust over the years.

447
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Maybe it's time to revisit it, but that would also be a very long process and possibly very

448
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
controversial.

449
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,680
There are other definitions, by the way.

450
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,560
There's the free software definition and there's a Debian soft, I think it's called the software

451
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
contract.

452
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,600
I don't know if I'm getting that wrong.

453
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,680
But those are much shorter and less complicated.

454
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:01,280
So I think if it were revised, there might be some interesting possibilities to harmonize

455
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,920
those definitions.

456
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,160
I would say that whether the definition changes or not is one question.

457
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,480
I do think that the transparency of the criteria for approval is very important to the community.

458
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,640
What's at stake for these companies and organizations?

459
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,040
Maybe they pick SSPL.

460
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,560
Whether or not it's an approved license or not, what do they win or lose based on that?

461
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,680
Is it the marketing value of the term?

462
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Is it goodwill?

463
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,880
What's at stake?

464
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,920
SSPL is used as part of a dual licensing model and that is something that has been around

465
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,380
for a long time, but it's not as popular as it once was.

466
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:50,540
So it was really pioneered by MySQL and so what they did was they said, here's our software.

467
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,080
It's under GPL.

468
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,520
Actually they used a variant of GPL and if you don't want to abide by the GPL requirements,

469
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,920
you can negotiate with us for a commercial license and that's a process that's sometimes

470
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,360
called selling exceptions.

471
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:16,160
So the strong copyleft licenses like GPL and then later AGPL and then finally SSPL were

472
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:23,240
all used in other contexts as well, but as part of these dual licensing initiatives.

473
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,920
The reason that companies adopted them in a dual licensing strategy is that they were

474
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,320
intending that people who are using the software commercially would probably have to come negotiate

475
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,400
for a license and what happened over time was that the MySQL model, which worked pretty

476
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:49,440
well, began to break when software moved up to the cloud because the requirements of GPL

477
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,520
only kicked in on redistribution and that wasn't happening anymore because of cloud

478
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,800
deployment.

479
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:04,660
So then companies that were doing dual licensing models moved to AGPL when it was released

480
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:14,060
in I think that was 2007 and SSPL is I think kind of a logical extension from that.

481
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,400
So that's what they're trying to do.

482
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:26,140
They're trying to allow people to use the software for certain in a say to test it out,

483
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:32,820
to use it on a small scale, to use it to do certain things, but to require people to come

484
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:39,160
to the table when they want to do things at scale or certain kind of commercial activities.

485
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,720
Yeah, because a cloud provider is a user essentially, right?

486
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,040
I mean at that point.

487
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,260
Yes, that's actually very perceptive comment.

488
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
They are users.

489
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,880
They're not distributors of software.

490
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,200
It's a little bit of a complicated question, but I don't think there's too much doubt about

491
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
that.

492
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,520
So what that means, if you look at the GPL say, it specifically says that the license

493
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,160
doesn't control the use of software.

494
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:17,280
And so that is where the issue comes to play because the cloud providers are users and

495
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:24,260
so under say GPL, they don't have any, you know, basically don't have any conditions

496
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
at all.

497
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
Right.

498
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,280
And it's kind of odd to say, I mean, sure they're not distributing it out to, you know,

499
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,200
individual installations, but they are providing it to many.

500
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,820
So it's still one to many, it's still many scenarios.

501
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,280
So and that seems to be where the issue is that the language of the future of software

502
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,200
the way it is, is not so much, especially in cloud, is not a distributed model.

503
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
That's right.

504
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
It's a single installation.

505
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
The means of distribution has changed.

506
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,160
You're no longer sending a binary or source code to be compiled by a bunch of people.

507
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,920
You're setting up a service and then charging for the service.

508
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,200
It's just, it's a new way of doing it, newer.

509
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Yeah.

510
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,600
And, you know, copyright law treats use and distribution a little bit differently.

511
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,160
I think that one of the things that maybe it didn't anticipate properly was use, was

512
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:19,160
copying at scale in order to deploy software for hundreds or thousands of users.

513
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,600
That is something that is, you know, relatively new.

514
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,960
So as software licensing has progressed, you know, certain things worked pretty well when

515
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,200
we were in a model where one person would use one copy of the software, but that isn't

516
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,780
the world we live in anymore.

517
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:44,640
So when it comes to the letter of the SSPL as reactions to Mongo initially, and now Elastic

518
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,280
re-licensing now, there have been critics, there have been, and this is a debated thing

519
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,680
about the topic, is it open source?

520
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,720
Is it fopen source?

521
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,560
Which is, I think is a terrible term.

522
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,460
I can't believe I just hopped on the bandwagon and used it, but this is the verbiage that's

523
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,320
out there.

524
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,200
There are those who think it's a business risk, this SSPL.

525
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,640
So now I'm reading from Vicky Bressour's blog, you probably have read this, and she says,

526
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,840
she showed it to some lawyers, some IP lawyers, and she says, by using an SSPL project in

527
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,900
your code, you are agreeing that if you provide an online service using that code, then you

528
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,960
will release not only that code, but also the code for every supporting piece of software

529
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,640
all under the SSPL.

530
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,480
It's not a stretch to interpret the wording of the license as requiring users of the SSPL

531
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,600
software, therefore to release the code for everything straight down to the bare metal.

532
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:44,660
This is one interpretation of the license itself saying effectively that there's perhaps

533
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,000
this collateral damage that might happen because of the way that it's written.

534
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,440
I would just love to hear as the author of it, and I'm sure you've thought through these

535
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,360
things, how do you respond to that?

536
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,320
What do you think about that statement?

537
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
Is it feasible?

538
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Is it outlandish?

539
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,800
Well, I do think it's an oversimplification of the terms of the license.

540
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,920
And don't get me wrong, these kinds of provisions are very complicated to read.

541
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,720
So it's hard to reduce them to sound bites.

542
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:24,140
I do think on the question of business risk, this is the way I look at it.

543
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,820
I work with many, many companies to develop open source compliance policies.

544
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,880
And so what companies do when they develop those policies is they have like a stop-go

545
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,960
caution list.

546
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,080
And you would not expect even a GPL to be on a go list.

547
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,760
In fact, it's usually on a stop list already.

548
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,200
And SSPL will be there too.

549
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,760
Any network copyleft license, meaning any license that has source code sharing requirements

550
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,960
when you deploy over a network, those will all be on a stop list.

551
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:12,040
So when you say it's a business risk, well, yeah, but already a lot of the copyleft licenses

552
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,280
were defined as business risks.

553
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,600
You know this isn't blindsiding you, this concern.

554
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,400
It's known from the out start.

555
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,200
Yeah, of course.

556
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,040
You would not expect people to greenlight SSPL software.

557
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,400
What they would do is they would look at the license and say, okay, this is okay with us

558
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
or it's not, and then they would make a decision about it.

559
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,760
So that's something that users have to decide for themselves.

560
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,300
I do think that what you quoted was overstating the risk somewhat, but it's not useful to

561
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,040
get into the details of it.

562
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,560
You have to actually look at what the license requires.

563
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:09,680
And it really is focused on particular use contexts where people are providing software

564
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,680
as a service.

565
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,420
I want to say thank you to Vicky for writing this post because I'm going to quote one more

566
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,720
and ask you about this, but very, very helpful, Vicky, in doing this call with Heather.

567
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,840
She said basically in regards to the SSPL, basically it's a hostile proprietary license

568
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,160
masquerading in open source clothing.

569
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Now it's getting vicious.

570
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,480
I don't know what to say about that.

571
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,800
Whether it's proprietary, proprietary is not open source.

572
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,320
So this is really the same issue.

573
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:48,960
I actually think if you look at the FAQs and announcements and so forth for Mongo and Elastic,

574
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,720
they're pretty forthcoming.

575
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:58,360
So I'm not sure what is being masqueraded there.

576
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:08,520
So I think that's, you know, it's language intended to incite an argument, but I don't

577
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,840
know that it's terribly meaningful in an objective way.

578
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Yeah.

579
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,480
The primary concern with the SSPL really is Section 13, right?

580
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,880
That's the, like a lot of the concern isn't really elsewhere in it.

581
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,440
Obviously it's a loan license, but it's primarily Section 13, which describes, which we talked

582
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,840
about here, which is redistribution, restrictions on usage, et cetera.

583
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah.

584
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:38,360
If you were to redline it against AGPL or even GPL3, you would find that almost all

585
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,520
the substantive changes are in Section 13.

586
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,560
Well, Heather, thank you so much for joining us and explaining these things in ways that

587
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,000
we could only fumble around in the dark to understand.

588
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,540
I think it's been very helpful.

589
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,720
And anything else that we didn't ask you or anything about the license itself or about

590
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,880
the situation that is being discussed and debated that you want to say that we haven't

591
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
asked you about?

592
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,120
Well, I would say that I would remind people that the alternative is probably to go to

593
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,000
a source available license.

594
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,760
So if people, you know, are calling it names and so forth, you know, what they should consider

595
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,960
is that businesses are going to do what their business strategy requires.

596
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,280
And so most companies that don't adopt something like SSPL are going to go down the source

597
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,720
available route, which is definitely not open source.

598
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,600
So it's a question of whether you think half a loaf is better than none, I think.

599
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,000
And there are definitely differing views about that.

600
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,480
I would say the reality is that most companies are actually going to use licenses that are

601
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,340
truly restrictive in a way rather than SSPL.

602
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:01,760
So I would say anybody who is using SSPL is at least trying to go down something like

603
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:15,280
an open source route, even if you don't believe it's open source.

604
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,480
Up next, we're talking about Manish John, founder and CTO at Dgraph Labs.

605
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,040
Manish came on this podcast a little over two years ago on episode 322, talking about

606
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,900
licensing and re-licensing Dgraph, so we thought it'd be fitting to get him on this episode

607
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
as well.

608
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Here we go.

609
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,640
So Manish, you and Dgraph are in a somewhat similar situation to Elastic.

610
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,540
You're not Elastic, but you're set up a lot like Elastic is set up, is that right?

611
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,760
That's true.

612
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,840
So Elastic's licensing, the way they have done it is that they have their open source

613
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,240
code co-located with their proprietary code, and it's all source visible, except the open

614
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:56,280
source is under Apache if I'm not wrong, and then the proprietary code is under Elastic.

615
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,240
And similar to Dgraph, where our open source code is Apache, and our proprietary code is

616
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,280
under Dgraph license.

617
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,800
So as a meta note, where did you hear about this news, and did you read both sides, have

618
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,520
you read what AWS has had to say, and what's happened after the re-license, what's your

619
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
purview?

620
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,480
I mean, I think, I mean, hacker news, right?

621
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,760
Hacker news went into flames over this, and so that's where I came to know.

622
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,360
I don't know, actually, I did not have a chance to look at what AWS actually had to say about

623
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
that.

624
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,760
But I did read through the multiple blog posts that Elastic sort of released about what they're

625
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,960
changing and some of the reasonings for why they're changing.

626
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,280
And this is a story that's, it's not the first time, right, it's the same story that we already

627
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:50,880
had for CockroachDB, we had the story for MongoDB, we have this, you know, across Confluent,

628
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,720
and Redis Labs, you know, this is just a series of changes that are happening in the entire

629
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
open source ecosystem.

630
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,760
And you guys went through similar things as well, because we even have a whole show up

631
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,160
for you back in October of 2018, where we have you on the changelog there and back again,

632
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:15,020
Dgraph's Tale, an excellent name if you're a fan of The Hobbit, like I am, episode 322.

633
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,060
So you've told us this story before, but like, I guess we don't need to rehash the entire

634
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:23,640
thing, but this has been an area of struggle for you and your company as well.

635
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,320
It is something of, you know, I wouldn't say it's such a big struggle as something like

636
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,680
Elastic where Amazon is directly sort of like, you know, quote unquote, attacking them, right?

637
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,540
For us, it's more of like a forward thinking scenario where we, you know, we realize that

638
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,680
we love open source.

639
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,840
And just like Shae mentioned, the founder of Elastic mentioned in his blog posts, you

640
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,600
know, I got my feet dabbed into open source like long time ago and really believe in it.

641
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,400
And when I was starting Dgraph, I was not inspired by any sort of business motives,

642
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
right?

643
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,120
Like I was not planning out, hey, how would like five years from now we will make money.

644
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,160
I didn't know how to make money from open source.

645
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,240
I just wanted to build open source software, right?

646
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,060
And that's how we got started.

647
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,400
So similar sort of like trajectory there in terms of like our interest towards the open

648
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:24,160
source community and so, you know, I mean, yeah, I think the open source theme is similar

649
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
there.

650
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:32,840
So what's happened since is that AWS has forked both Elasticsearch and Kibana and are going

651
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,840
to carry on open source forks, community forks as they're kind of being pitched as what do

652
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
you think about that?

653
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
What are they going to succeed?

654
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,280
Are they going to fail there?

655
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,240
Is it a real risk for Elastic or no?

656
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,340
They did that once before with the Elastic open distro and I think people were really

657
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,200
concerned about how that would pan out.

658
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,820
And remind me, Elastic's share price has not decreased too much, right?

659
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,580
It hasn't gone into a spiral downward.

660
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,200
So I guess they're doing well, right?

661
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,460
And they'll probably survive another attack from AWS.

662
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:12,740
But I think, you know, some of the criticism that I see online about MongoDB, SSBL and

663
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,180
some other companies is that, you know, these open source companies are motivated by business

664
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:25,880
and therefore they are somehow being moralistic, like morally they are being challenged.

665
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,360
But I feel like, you know, the same people then turn around and say Amazon is completely

666
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,520
okay with doing these kind of things because it's well within their rights to do so because

667
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,200
of the licensing put together by the open source.

668
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,620
And so the conflict that I feel is right there, right?

669
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:50,200
You cannot have two different moral bars, one for the company who is making money out

670
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:59,720
of your inventions and the second for the inventor themselves, right?

671
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,180
And sometimes I just wonder, right, how many open source infrastructure software has Amazon

672
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,160
created and launched in open source, right?

673
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,400
Like do we, when do we expect to see DynamoDB coming out in open source?

674
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,840
So someone else can build a business like Amazon has done with DynamoDB.

675
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
That'll be great, right?

676
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,620
I mean, that'll be a great day for open source if Amazon does that.

677
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,220
But I don't think they have any plan to do it because that's not how they operate.

678
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,080
And so, you know, it's well within, I think it's, in fact, I would say it's recommended

679
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,720
for open source companies to make sure that they are able to build a successful business

680
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,040
just like Amazon is building, just like everybody else is building.

681
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:48,640
And so the motivation to make money out of your inventions is completely justified in,

682
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,520
I would say, moral grounds, right?

683
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:58,240
Well, there's a concern too, at least based upon Shay's blog post on Elastic saying that

684
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,040
Amazon and AWS wasn't putting back into the open source buckets, so to speak.

685
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,000
So from two avenues, one, the perspective you just shared, which is DynamoDB, for example,

686
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,300
isn't open source, and that's not part of their business plan to do that.

687
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,440
But then the concern and I suppose what led to this scenario we're in now is essentially

688
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,320
AWS not playing by the community rules.

689
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,040
The license doesn't depict this, and that's kind of what this move is doing is like, hey,

690
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,920
if you can't operate by community rules, then we're going to put a license that makes it

691
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,760
illegal for you to do things another way.

692
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,920
So not pitching back into the open source thing.

693
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,200
But then you can sort of draw some sentiment from just simply the titles of their blog

694
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:49,720
post on the AWS open source blog back in 2019 from Adrian Cockroft, keeping open source

695
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,920
open, open distro for Elasticsearch, which is something you mentioned.

696
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,040
And then the second one is the more recent around Elasticsearch, which is stepping up

697
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,720
for a truly open source Elasticsearch.

698
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,640
It's an interesting perspective you've drawn there where they haven't open source certain

699
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,160
things they have because of business reasons, but then wanting to be a good community player

700
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,160
in these ways.

701
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,020
It seems, I don't know, what do you think?

702
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,360
It is questionable, isn't it?

703
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,680
It is kind of questionable.

704
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,240
And I think like, you know, if you look at SSPL, the server side public license, I think

705
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,200
from MongoDB, it's actually really, I actually am still a bit baffled that it's not approved

706
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,600
by OSI because it to me is a fork of derivative of GPL, just like AGPL is, which also makes

707
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,380
GPL a bit more permissive, right?

708
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,480
If you look at AGPL, it's, you know, allows you to not have to release your source code

709
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,320
if you are using it over the network or something of that sort, or actually, I forget exactly

710
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,720
the details there.

711
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,720
But SSPL says that, you know, you don't have to release your source code if you're not

712
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,780
directly competing by providing the core product as a service, right?

713
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,720
So it's more permissive than a GPL.

714
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,840
And so I think it has all the merits, I feel in my opinion, to be open source approved

715
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:14,640
and guess if SSPL in a world where SSPL gets open source approval, I don't think we have

716
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,320
any problem here, right?

717
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,640
Then everybody has already sort of like gathered around SSPL, which we could not do around

718
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,040
the commons clause, right?

719
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,440
I mean, that was the same idea for commons clause, but it could not get us there.

720
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,040
But MongoDB is a big name, and so MongoDB could get the industry around SSPL.

721
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,880
And then we don't have a debate because it would be open source, right?

722
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
Yeah.

723
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,880
There's some details around that.

724
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,760
We had a conversation with Heather Maker on this exact subject and something she had said,

725
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:51,460
which will be in the same podcast, is if you redlined SSPL versus AGPL, the primary difference

726
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:57,440
is this sort of come out is essentially section 13, which describes if you make the functionality

727
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,840
of the program or modified version available to third parties of the service, blah, blah,

728
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,840
blah, blah, blah.

729
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,720
That's where the change is, is section 13.

730
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,780
Everything else is essentially AGPL.

731
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,320
And there is a lot of debate around the nuance and the process to be approved.

732
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,920
So OSD is very clear, hasn't changed in a long time, OSD being the open source definition.

733
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,420
That's very clear because it hasn't changed and it's even derived from Debian's existing

734
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,160
rules on what open source definition is.

735
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,260
So there's some history there, but the criteria and the ways that you go about getting these

736
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:33,760
licenses approved by OSI is a bit more difficult.

737
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,440
You can read the transcripts and the notes from the meetings and stuff, but that takes

738
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,560
a very motivated listener slash reader.

739
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,820
And so some of this intention of this show is to sort of demystify some of that stuff

740
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:53,640
and maybe give you a TLDR or TLDL, too long, didn't listen, but that's essentially is this

741
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,820
criteria for getting it passed.

742
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:01,220
You say that the SSPL should be or could be open source, you're baffled, as you said,

743
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,220
that it's not.

744
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,220
Yeah.

745
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
Yeah.

746
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
And it's not, that it hasn't been approved by them.

747
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,220
Yeah.

748
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,760
And to be honest, like I haven't looked at the counter arguments to that, right?

749
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,360
And I'm sure there's, there are smart people there on the other side and they have some

750
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,360
counter arguments.

751
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:21,360
But from a slightly like distant perspective, without having to go into the intricate details,

752
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,840
it seems very similar.

753
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:30,400
And maybe if it was built in 1990s, it might have already been involved in OSI, right?

754
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,180
But I think one thing that we should probably take away from ElastiX stuff is that the holy

755
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:42,640
grail of license here is to, so if you look at ElastiX license as well, right, it's divided

756
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,760
into two portions.

757
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,440
One is the open source part and the other one is the completely proprietary part, right?

758
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,280
And so proprietary part, they are not changing, from my understanding, they are changing the

759
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,600
open source part of their code and making it available via either SSPL or the ElastiX

760
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
license.

761
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,360
And both of them sort of in some shape or form disallow building a competing service,

762
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,360
right?

763
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,360
Right.

764
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,840
Restricts cloud service providers from offering, this is quotes, that's what it says, restricts

765
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,240
cloud service providers from offering our service as a service.

766
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
Right.

767
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,600
And that's in violation of OSI 6.

768
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,360
And they are very clear about it's not, it's only to third parties, not for internal usage.

769
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,680
So if I am a big company and I need to build a product, I can provide it as a service to

770
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:33,200
my other teams in the company, just not to your users directly, right?

771
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,740
That's a commercial restriction.

772
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,000
Don't compete with me essentially.

773
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Exactly.

774
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

775
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Right.

776
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,840
Because you can compete internally inside your own company, not make any money from

777
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,000
it, but get great usage of the software.

778
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,160
But you can't create a competing company against the inventor.

779
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,120
This goes back to what you were saying before, the inventor or the user of the invention.

780
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,120
Exactly.

781
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,120
Yeah.

782
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,560
And they can still build a commercial product on it, just not a competing service, right?

783
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,680
But the holy grail would be to offer a single license, right?

784
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,720
That takes away, hey, this is proprietary part of the code and this is the quote unquote

785
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,800
open source or similar to open source part of the code.

786
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,880
And ideally what looks like what they want to get to is to offer a single license that

787
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:23,440
can cover both their free and their paid features while being as open as possible, right?

788
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,160
And if that would be there, I think we would jump on it immediately because we also currently

789
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:37,200
have dual license, which is what Cockroach has, which is what Elastic has and many others

790
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,320
have.

791
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,200
But having that single license would be the holy grail.

792
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,660
And I don't know if you wanted to talk also about BSL, right?

793
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:55,420
Which is the MariaDB's license, where they say that the initial code is going to be proprietary,

794
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,040
but after a certain amount of time, three to five years, it will become open source

795
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:05,600
and it would become Apache 2 or something liberal, which is what Cockroach is doing.

796
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:12,000
CockroachDB is doing, so they're open source, they switched to Cockroach BSL modifications

797
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
slightly.

798
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,900
That's also a great way to essentially say the same thing, right?

799
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:27,920
Which is, please don't compete with us by providing a service to our core product.

800
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,840
And if you think in terms of what's the corporate for Amazon, let's say e-commerce is a core

801
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:40,840
product and if you were to use Amazon machines or Amazon technology to actually build a competing

802
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,280
stuff, I'm pretty sure they'll be pretty pissed as well.

803
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,960
And so all these companies are doing is that we have spent a lot of time and effort into

804
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,200
building and this is our main source of living, right?

805
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
Just play nicely.

806
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,960
Otherwise we have to invent new licenses.

807
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,200
Yeah, David Kramer shared some of his sentiment on that subject because Century was licensed

808
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,640
to BDS3 and transitioned to the BSL.

809
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,080
And I'm paraphrasing, but what I can recall from that conversation, episode 371, Real

810
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,080
Licensing Century, was essentially David was saying, I want to do whatever it takes to

811
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:21,280
help me run this commercial business, but also respect open source because without the

812
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,540
business making the thing, there is no thing.

813
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:29,240
And that's a paraphrase of David's sentiment on that, but that's essentially what he

814
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:36,740
boiled it down to was his concern in regards to transitioning away from BDS3 to the business

815
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,040
source license, which you mentioned.

816
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,040
Yeah.

817
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,800
And actually if you think about what is happening, right, like, you know, I mean, again, I argue

818
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,640
that SSPL is very close to open source, to the AGPL or GPL, right?

819
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,800
But SSPL is not open source.

820
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,760
So what's actually happening right now is a bunch of open source companies which truly

821
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,600
believe in open source are having to switch to quote unquote non-open source licenses.

822
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,600
And that's not, that's not great, right?

823
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,080
And the funny thing is they are all talking about the same one player in the market, right?

824
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,920
They're not talking about a Google or about Microsoft or anybody else.

825
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,800
In fact, in the Elastic blog post, they mentioned that they have played very nicely with all

826
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,800
the other players in the ecosystem, just the AWS, right?

827
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,680
So I have no personal, yeah, exactly.

828
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,920
I mean, I have no personal thing against AWS, right?

829
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,040
Like we run on AWS, we are completely fine.

830
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,360
And from what I understand, they're not trying to build a D-graph alternative, right?

831
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,120
But there is something there where if a bunch of companies are talking about the same, you

832
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:50,240
know, quote unquote, curious actor, yeah, let's call him an actor.

833
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,800
I don't want to say a bad actor, right?

834
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
Because exactly.

835
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,160
Because we just don't know, but we're a curious actor.

836
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,840
I think there must be something there, right?

837
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:02,000
Do you think then, given that we had just said that the OSI, that it's in their best

838
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,600
interest for open source to help these businesses that have this concern, have this trouble

839
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:16,080
to create an open source license that give them the needs they have to sort of solve

840
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:21,880
the needs they have, these problems, but also adhere to the letter of open source, because

841
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:28,080
if you look at the intent, it seems like they're intending to respect and live within a world

842
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:33,720
of open source, whether it's for the, in quotes, open source brand name that can't be trademarked

843
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:39,240
because it's not trademarkable, but it certainly has a marketability to it.

844
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:45,520
Like if you masquerade as faux open source, is that right, Jared, faux open source?

845
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,520
That's right.

846
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,520
Then you're not open source.

847
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,480
There is a marketability to seeing you're open source for sure.

848
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,480
Absolutely.

849
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,480
Yeah.

850
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,480
And I think, you know, we do open source because it allows, it's not just a way to have more

851
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,160
eyes and make sure that the product is, that the score is of high quality and so and so

852
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,280
forth, but there's also, it's a distribution model, right?

853
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,280
It's a distribution model.

854
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,960
It's a way by which you think your software could be consumed by anybody without necessarily

855
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,960
having to pay you.

856
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,960
Right.

857
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,160
So they are not saying that if you build a commercially successful product using our

858
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,040
software payers, they are not saying that.

859
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,320
They're just saying like, just don't build a competing service against us.

860
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:35,360
And also going back to the first, the initiation of a bunch of these open source companies,

861
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:41,760
it started with like one or multiple like people who just believed in open source, right?

862
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,840
They just wanted to make things in open source because they have consumed open source software.

863
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
Their life.

864
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Right.

865
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,800
So when I was like in college, I was all into Linux and I was playing with Gentoo and Ubuntu

866
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,140
and I don't know, like whatever other Linux flavor there was out there, FreeBSD, NetBSD.

867
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,200
And I just believed in open source.

868
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,540
And that was our stance against, you know, Windows at the time, right?

869
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:12,320
And so I've created multiple projects, some of which actually got popular, including Dgraph.

870
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,800
And then we have Badger and then we have Strato and they are all open source because we just

871
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
believe in it.

872
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Right.

873
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,360
It's a bit of like a pain to, to have to move away from that, even in theory, right?

874
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:29,300
Even in theory, just because of this, this one problem.

875
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:36,560
So Manish, clean slate, start Dgraph over today, same exact software, same business,

876
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,560
pick a license.

877
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,560
I love it.

878
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:45,040
What are you going to go with?

879
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:50,200
I think SSPL is looking pretty attractive, SSPL is looking pretty attractive right now.

880
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,500
And also like, just notice one more thing, right?

881
00:59:53,500 --> 01:00:00,220
From 2010 or 2015, the world has changed to be more cloud first and on-prem later than

882
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,640
on-prem first and cloud later approach, right?

883
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,280
And so if I were, if I were or somebody else were to build a service today, they might

884
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,680
choose not to even make it open source.

885
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,500
They might say, you know what, Snowflake has done really well by being completely cloud-based

886
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,500
system.

887
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,160
And if I'm not wrong, Snowflake is not open source, right?

888
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,060
And so, so why open source, right?

889
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:26,260
Maybe that, maybe that could be the question is like, open source already has tons of problems

890
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:31,360
because there is, you know, actor or multiple actors like causing so many issues, like why

891
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,640
bother with all that?

892
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,680
Just avoid all of that and just go completely cloud source.

893
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,900
And you could still build a good business out of it, right?

894
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,840
And so that, then it becomes just a question of principle, right?

895
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,160
Do you still really believe in open source?

896
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,920
Do you still believe that your code should be, we should be, other people should be able

897
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,920
to check it and make sure that you're not doing anything fishy or help you find bugs

898
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,800
or, you know, that kind of stuff.

899
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:04,920
So it becomes a matter of principle and a matter of business, it seems like.

900
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,280
This episode of The Change Log is brought to you by Render.

901
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,040
Render is a unified platform to build and run all your apps and websites with free SSL,

902
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,280
a global CDN, private networks, and auto deploys from Git.

903
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,480
They handle everything from simple static sites to complex applications with dozens

904
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,480
of microservices.

905
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,400
If you're a developer or a founder that's frustrated with AWS's complexity or Heroku's

906
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,680
high costs, you owe it to yourself to use the $100 in free credits they're giving our

907
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,980
listeners to give Render a try.

908
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:40,680
Render is built for modern applications and offers everything you need out of the box.

909
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,200
One-click scaling, zero downtime deploys, built-in SSL, private networking, managed

910
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,440
databases, secrets and configuration management, persistent block storage, and infrastructure

911
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,440
as code.

912
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,800
Heroku customers running production and staging workloads typically see cost reductions of

913
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,240
over 50% after switching to Render.

914
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Here's the best part.

915
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,920
We work closely with the team at Render to ensure you have zero risk by giving you $100

916
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,240
in free credits, plus they're going to assign a world-class engineer to your account to

917
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,440
offer guidance and answer any questions you have.

918
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,200
When you're ready to transition your infrastructure, they'll be there to help you with that too.

919
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,580
Automate your cloud hosting with Render at render.com slash changelog, get $100 in free

920
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,840
credits to try the Render platform, plus a world-class engineer assigned to your account

921
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:29,160
to guide you along the way to send an email to our special email changelog at render.com

922
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,000
to get access to those free credits.

923
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:47,240
All that begins at render.com slash changelog.

924
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,720
Coming up in this segment, we're talking with Paul Dix, co-founder and CTO at Influx Data.

925
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,260
Paul shares his perspective on running an open source business, how Influx Data is innovating

926
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,720
their commercial offering while having a permissive MIT licensed version of InfluxDB.

927
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,800
Paul also shares his thoughts on this standoff between Elastic and AWS and why he's long

928
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,840
on Mongo and short on Elastic.

929
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Here we go.

930
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,880
So Paul, tell us, tell us your name, tell us your company and kind of your view of the

931
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,240
open source world, where your opinion is coming from.

932
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,960
Uh, yeah, so I'm Paul Dix.

933
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,400
I'm the CTO and co-founder of Influx Data.

934
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,800
We're the makers of InfluxDB, which is an open source time series database.

935
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,240
Uh, I created it in 2013 and I've been, uh, initially running the company and then as

936
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,120
CTO, uh, which I'm still doing to this day.

937
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:41,880
So my experience over that time has basically been trying to build a business around, uh,

938
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,620
an open source software project, particularly in infrastructure software and in databases

939
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,940
in particular.

940
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,360
So Elastic, obviously I'm very familiar with.

941
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,840
I saw it when they, you know, were initially becoming a company.

942
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,040
I remember the project early on.

943
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,720
Some of the work that they've done was, you know, served as inspiration to me as I was

944
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:04,120
building out Influx and the various parts of our stack.

945
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,880
Very similar software, very similar business model.

946
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,480
It looks like Influx is MIT.

947
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,440
Can you tell us like your license selection and how your business works around it?

948
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Yeah.

949
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,520
So all of the open source software that we create is MIT licensed and our business model

950
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:23,080
is basically, so we are essentially at this point an open core business.

951
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,680
So there's open source InfluxDB, which is MIT licensed.

952
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,720
People can do whatever, what they want with it.

953
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,080
Uh, it works essentially as a single server.

954
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:37,480
We have a fork of the open source project that is closed source and proprietary.

955
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,840
If you want high availability or scale out clustering of InfluxDB, that is our commercial

956
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
offering, right?

957
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,260
So essentially we don't put clustering features into the open source.

958
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,080
Everything else is fair game to go into the open source.

959
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:56,080
If it has to do with a single server, optimizing query performance, APIs, functionality, all

960
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,040
that kind of stuff, it goes into free open source.

961
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:08,360
So we, we launched this as a, you know, managed service inside of AWS in, I think it was April

962
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,180
of 2016.

963
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:15,760
We launched it as basically like on premise software product that people could buy in

964
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,440
September of 2016.

965
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,880
Our AWS service is still running to this day.

966
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,980
Essentially what that is, is it's the closed source software spun up, you know, a customer

967
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,080
can come and sign up.

968
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:33,500
They say what size, you know, instances they want, how much storage, how many instances.

969
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,840
We spin up the, you know, the closed source enterprise version of our product on it.

970
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,720
We add monitoring and backups and stuff like that.

971
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:47,200
And then, you know, that's, that's the hosted version of the product, the what I say on

972
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:53,640
premise version is essentially you buy the software from us, it's an annual subscription

973
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,920
and then you run and manage it yourself.

974
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,080
And that's either in your own data centers, but plenty of people are also doing it inside

975
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,780
of AWS, GCP, all that kind of stuff.

976
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:12,280
Last year, or I guess late 2019 now, we launched basically version two of our cloud product.

977
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:17,840
And that essentially is, it's a very different kind of thing because it's not just a database

978
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,280
and it doesn't look anything like the open source software that we create.

979
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,440
The API is the same, but the underlying like architecture and how everything works together

980
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,200
is completely different.

981
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,340
And that's for version 2.0 of InfluxDB.

982
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:37,520
So the model we switched to with 2.0, we essentially moved to a cloud first model.

983
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,720
So we deliver that cloud product continuously as like a SaaS service.

984
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:49,760
And then over time, some of those features get pulled out into the open source InfluxDB.

985
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,000
Is that because of a realization that the other way wasn't working well enough or it's

986
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,280
just, why did you switch to the cloud first model?

987
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,400
Basically because it has nothing to do with open source versus closed, it has everything

988
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,900
to do with software delivery cycles.

989
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,400
So before we looked very much like an enterprise software company.

990
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,660
We'd have anywhere from two to four feature-bearing releases a year, which could then get shipped

991
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,960
to our cloud customers and shipped to our on-premise customers.

992
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,120
The problem with that is you don't get that many cycles of iteration and each release

993
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,200
is like super painful to do because there's so much code wrapped up in it.

994
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,980
So I really wanted to move to a continuous delivery model.

995
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,620
So we could get much faster feedback, features out to customers quicker, and the individual

996
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,020
releases would be much, much smaller.

997
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:43,880
So that had to do with basically wanting to be a cloud company and deliver a cloud product

998
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,600
as opposed to deliver like a packaged on-premise enterprise product.

999
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,240
How does that trickle down to your open source then?

1000
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:56,200
How does InfluxDB, the open source, benefit or not benefit from this switch?

1001
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,280
I think the benefit is that by the time something lands in open source, we've already vetted

1002
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,840
the features and vetted like its functionality and how it works inside our cloud products.

1003
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:13,160
The thing is with our cloud product, we're able to iterate on it and release fixes very

1004
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
quickly.

1005
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,280
Once you ship something in an open source release, it's much more painful to ship

1006
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,160
a fix, ship an update.

1007
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,340
So I think that's a benefit.

1008
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:29,520
The drawback is it's less, I think it reduces the collaboration with the community in terms

1009
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,440
of what we're developing and how it's getting done and all that kind of stuff.

1010
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,600
It basically makes like the open source like a downstream kind of product, right?

1011
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,600
Yeah.

1012
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,320
Well, that reflects the tweet you put out, which is my own preference is to keep open

1013
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:50,000
code permissive and open and have a clear strategy as you just depicted here with how

1014
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,960
that code will be used in the commercial offering.

1015
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,480
So you're eating your own dolphin, which is good.

1016
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,480
Yeah.

1017
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:01,000
So there's, what I just described is basically our 2.0 model, but actually I'm actually trying

1018
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,320
to move even beyond that over to what I call basically like complimentary software model,

1019
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:09,320
right?

1020
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:15,520
So we have a new project that we announced a few months ago called InfluxDB Iox, which

1021
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,320
is basically the new core of the database written in Rust using Apache Arrow.

1022
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:25,240
And the way that we're building this out is essentially there's the open source thing,

1023
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,560
and then there's another piece of software that we have that is closed source.

1024
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,240
And as a whole, the system is designed to be two pieces of software, one of which is

1025
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,120
totally open and permissive, permissively licensed, you know, you can do whatever you

1026
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,120
want with it.

1027
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,120
You can compete with us.

1028
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,120
That's fine.

1029
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,380
That's by design.

1030
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:44,320
And then the other piece, which is the software that we're writing to be able to run the open

1031
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,600
source software in our cloud offering.

1032
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,480
So the reason why I say it's complimentary is because what I want is I want our cloud

1033
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:56,320
product to be running the open source bits exactly as is, like exactly as the open source

1034
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:02,080
community experiences them, because it means we'll find bugs faster.

1035
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,960
It also means we can have more of a collaborative effort with the community in terms of making

1036
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:12,360
improvements because we're not like right now with our cloud two offering like InfluxDB

1037
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,400
2.0 open source is one project.

1038
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,720
Cloud two is totally separate.

1039
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:23,560
Now we use some of the libraries from InfluxDB 2.0, but it's not like, it's not even like

1040
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,040
a fork of the project.

1041
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:32,520
It's literally two separate projects and products and they have the, they have like the same

1042
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,520
API.

1043
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
Yeah.

1044
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,520
Two masters.

1045
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,520
Right.

1046
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
Exactly.

1047
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
Yeah.

1048
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
With, with Iox and this other.

1049
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,520
In terms of serving two masters is what I mean.

1050
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,520
Like literally you're serving two masters.

1051
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,800
You have two different projects.

1052
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,360
It's very difficult to serve both easily.

1053
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:51,720
And like internally we have a separate team that works on the open source bits versus

1054
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,440
the people working on the cloud, closed source cloud product.

1055
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,440
Right.

1056
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,960
I asked you the benefits of the open source and it seemed like the benefits of the open

1057
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,800
source was obvious, but they're different because they're separate.

1058
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
That's what it seemed like.

1059
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,160
I was going to ask you about that because it seems like with your cloud two that you

1060
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,440
mentioned, you can obviously push forward, but it's downstream.

1061
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,880
The open source is downstream and it seems like maybe, you know, just disconnected basically.

1062
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,880
Yeah.

1063
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,880
Yeah.

1064
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,880
It's a bit disconnected.

1065
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,600
Whereas like with this new model, again, like my goal is we offer it as a cloud product

1066
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,600
first.

1067
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,720
So that's, we're not doing that yet, but then later we'll offer it as an on-premise product.

1068
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:34,560
But the idea there is that people who adopt Iox and you know, deploy a bunch of servers

1069
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,720
and stuff like that, if they come to us and they want the on-premise product, it's a product

1070
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,480
that they add in addition to the open source software they're already running.

1071
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,480
Right.

1072
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
They continue to do that.

1073
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:50,440
It's very, very different than our old InfluxDB 1.x enterprise model where our enterprise

1074
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:55,280
product is a replacement for the open source InfluxDB, right?

1075
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:02,220
I think that's like a heavier lift and it's a bigger ask for users to replace their open

1076
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,220
source bits.

1077
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:07,120
Like it's better, I think it's better if they're able to run the open source bits and continue

1078
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,500
to have that experience because one, it makes the contribution easier.

1079
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,940
It makes it easier for them to consider adopting a commercial product because at that point

1080
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:20,640
they're saying like, okay, I have this commercial product, but it's not like I'm still using

1081
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,640
the open source bits.

1082
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,480
So I can still be sure that, you know, if the commercial relationship goes sour or I

1083
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,120
decide I don't like want that functionality, it's still good.

1084
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,520
I can still continue to use the open source bits.

1085
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:38,600
There's definitely some interesting ramifications that I think I would love to see play out

1086
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,600
as you go about deploying that new idea.

1087
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,780
Am I understanding correctly?

1088
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:49,680
It's kind of like the open source bits is like the core software offering and then the

1089
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:54,600
proprietary stuff is like a management controller or like a deployment type of a thing.

1090
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,200
Like it's all the things that surround it that you would be offering as a service perhaps,

1091
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,160
but this is as a licensable addition.

1092
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:05,240
Yeah, that's a good way of thinking of it.

1093
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:10,080
So yeah, it's basically all this code that we have to write to offer it as a service,

1094
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,080
right?

1095
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,380
Operations, backups, like deploying new versions of it, management, all this kind of stuff.

1096
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:21,420
The other thing is we want to be able to offer that as an on-premise piece of software.

1097
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:28,740
Another way to think about this is the open source thing represents the data plane, whereas

1098
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:32,520
our closed source product represents the control plane.

1099
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,980
But the way the two interact is the control plane interacts with the data plane through

1100
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,740
its public API and that public API is open source.

1101
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:45,440
So literally if somebody wanted to write an open source control plane for it, or if they

1102
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,120
wanted to write their own competing software products, they can do so.

1103
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,440
And the license totally permits that.

1104
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:57,800
And the thing is like, we don't have to worry about our open source bits competing with

1105
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:03,760
our commercial bits, because the truth is the responsibilities of the two pieces of

1106
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,900
software are clearly delineated.

1107
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,960
So it's like, there's no reason for people to put control plane bits into the main open

1108
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,480
source project.

1109
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,080
They would have to create a separate open source project to do it, which would make

1110
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
sense.

1111
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,080
Right.

1112
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:21,640
But at that point, you're kind of just deciding what is control plane and what is data plane.

1113
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:26,760
And that's kind of the same concept of what goes in core and what goes in proprietary,

1114
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,760
isn't it?

1115
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,760
What about backups?

1116
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:32,760
Well, it could go right into our core offering, but it's more of a control plane kind of a

1117
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,760
thing.

1118
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
So we'll put it over here.

1119
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,280
It seems like you still make those decisions.

1120
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,280
You just make them and the two pieces of software are further apart perhaps.

1121
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,960
I view them as further apart.

1122
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,640
When I think of open core businesses, I think of businesses where the commercial product

1123
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,720
is a replacement for the open source product.

1124
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,480
This is not that, and it's designed specifically not to be that.

1125
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,720
Like take data stacks, for instance.

1126
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,480
Data stacks enterprise is a replacement for Cassandra, right?

1127
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,800
And now like data stacks is obviously offering it as a service called Astra.

1128
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
That's doing well.

1129
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,480
But again, like that's an open core model.

1130
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,480
Gotcha.

1131
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:15,600
I think a good example is like Google and Kubernetes, right?

1132
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:25,880
Like open source Kubernetes certainly doesn't represent the entirety of GCP and all the

1133
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,560
software that runs that.

1134
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:35,120
But like obviously Google has a vested interest in driving Kubernetes forward and GCP happens

1135
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:41,160
to be like one of the best places to buy Kubernetes, to operate Kubernetes.

1136
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:45,680
So what's your thoughts on the server-side public license and Elastic's move?

1137
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:50,080
You obviously prefer this other way of going about it, but do you think it was smart by

1138
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
them, short-sighted?

1139
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,940
What's your take on that?

1140
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:56,600
So I don't think it's, it's not the move I would make.

1141
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:00,600
And you know, to be totally honest though, like to me it's not really about a license

1142
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,120
choice.

1143
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:09,160
It's more about how they intend to drive innovation that drives commercial value.

1144
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:15,320
And the truth is like I own stock in MongoDB, which is obviously SSPL licensed software,

1145
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,400
but I do not own stock in Elastic, nor would I buy stock in Elastic right now, yet I'm

1146
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,740
holding MongoDB, right?

1147
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,240
Even though they're both SSPL.

1148
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,680
So like from a pure, you know, mercenary investor perspective, I'm long Mongo, but I'm short

1149
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,640
Elastic and it has nothing to do with the license.

1150
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,320
I think them changing the license is more a symptom of the fact that they're getting

1151
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,320
out innovated on their cloud offering.

1152
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:46,600
If they had a cloud offering that was demonstrably better than Amazon's Elastic service, they

1153
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,880
would continue to be able to drive revenue and drive people to it.

1154
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:57,440
If they're so upset because they feel like, sorry, AWS is eating their lunch on the hosted

1155
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,960
offering, then they, you know, they change their license.

1156
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:08,200
Like I mean, ultimately like they had a choice, which was they either write more closed source

1157
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:17,200
code or they re-license their, you know, they continue to write code out in the open, I'm

1158
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:22,360
putting air quotes around this, but that code is under a different license.

1159
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:28,240
They chose the different license path, which to me, I think, I mean, personally, like I'm

1160
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,000
not a fan of source available licenses.

1161
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:41,040
I think they're a disservice to the community because, because then, yeah, they are disservice

1162
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,800
to the community because then you can say like, oh, community members like saw your

1163
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,720
code or whatever, like it just means that people can't start like competing projects

1164
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:58,280
with you without, you know, putting themselves at risk of being, you know, accused of taking

1165
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,400
your code or whatever.

1166
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Right?

1167
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,360
Like I prefer open code is open, closed code is closed.

1168
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:11,960
And the thing that kind of annoys me about the whole Elastic AWS standoff is both of

1169
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:17,580
them are trying to, you know, put forth this position that they have, you know, more the

1170
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:21,480
moral high ground there, you know, they have moral superiority over the other one, right?

1171
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:26,080
Like Amazon saying like, oh, we're protectors of open source, so we're going to launch this

1172
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,840
fork or whatever.

1173
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,000
And the truth is like, even when they did open distro, I called it a fork then, even

1174
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,520
though they said it's not a fork because it's just like, whatever, a build, it was all,

1175
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,580
it was always obvious, like when they launched that, that fork is what it was ultimately

1176
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:45,520
going to become because Elastic was going to take the stance that Amazon's stealing

1177
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,840
from us.

1178
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,500
So we're going to change the license of more and more of our code, which is then going

1179
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:55,760
to give Amazon no choice but to fork, right?

1180
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,620
So Amazon's claiming they have the moral high ground.

1181
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:00,620
It's not true.

1182
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:03,760
Like they just, they're just doing what's best for their customers and their shareholders,

1183
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,760
right?

1184
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,720
They're trying to optimize shareholder value.

1185
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,640
And obviously like all their customers are saying, like, host Elastic for us.

1186
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,560
And then Elastic is trying to say like, oh, we're doing this to protect ourselves from

1187
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,240
Amazon because they're stealing from us.

1188
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:21,380
I mean, the truth is there are tons of hosting companies that have been hosting Elastic for

1189
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,380
a long time.

1190
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:27,080
And if you look at where Elastic makes its money, it's probably mostly from log search.

1191
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:31,640
How many log search companies are built on top of Elastic and they just open that up,

1192
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,640
right?

1193
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:38,280
So Elastic is just upset because Amazon out competed them on the hosting front, whereas

1194
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,920
like other hosting providers like Compose and Avin and stuff like that didn't really

1195
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,840
make a dent in Elastic's top line, right?

1196
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,920
So their claim like, oh, we have to do this.

1197
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,920
Like, no, you don't.

1198
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,040
You could have kept the code Apache v2 and you could have like written more and more

1199
01:19:54,040 --> 01:20:00,680
code in your service offering that's closed source and kept the two separate, right?

1200
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,940
And this is actually one of the things that I agree with Amazon about where they said

1201
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:10,080
the reason they created the Open Distro was because Elastic was polluting the open source

1202
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:15,520
repo with code under different licenses, right, under the Elastic license and stuff like that.

1203
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,080
And what they've done now is they've gone all in on that strategy.

1204
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,720
So basically like they want all the benefits of being an open source company, you know,

1205
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,900
free marketing, free adoption, getting other people to talk about it, use it, whatever,

1206
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,320
but they don't want to pay the price.

1207
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:39,880
The price of being really open source is that you're giving software away for free, yes,

1208
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,660
you're being permissive, but that also means that anybody can take your software and compete

1209
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,680
with you, which you have to be okay with.

1210
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:54,400
Like anything that you can really call a platform is only a platform if the total economic activity

1211
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,740
of it outstrips that of any single vendor, right?

1212
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:03,360
So if you claim your platform, but basically you're getting all the money from it, no,

1213
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,360
you're not.

1214
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,360
Like, you're...

1215
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,680
A monopoly, as you said in your tweets.

1216
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,680
Right.

1217
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:13,440
This comes back to something you were saying, which in your stance for not 2.0 in terms

1218
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,340
of Influx and what you're doing, but the next version, I think you called it Iox, this maybe

1219
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,460
version three, I'm not sure what you call it, but you said by design.

1220
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:29,200
It's permissive and you've designed your architecture in terms of commercial offering to expect

1221
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,160
other competitors.

1222
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,760
Whereas it seems like Elastic, based on what you say and others have said, and even kind

1223
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,120
of what they're depicting is that they're upset that Amazon is eating their lunch and

1224
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,280
it's not by design.

1225
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,480
Their model is not by design to be competed with.

1226
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,480
Right, exactly.

1227
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,440
Like their hope was that they would get this massively popular project, which it is Elastic

1228
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:57,120
is top 10 database project, used the world over, but then they want...

1229
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:01,480
The classic strategy is you spend a bunch of money to get optimized growth and then

1230
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:07,680
once you have scale and a monopoly, you want to start collecting monopoly rents.

1231
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,680
Right.

1232
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:13,960
So now Elastic can't collect monopoly rents because other people are hosting Elastic.

1233
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,480
They're trying to change the model so they can do that, but the problem is then you're

1234
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,800
a different sort of business entirely, right?

1235
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
It's fine to be a closed source database company.

1236
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,200
There's Fauna, which is new, Firebase is closed source.

1237
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Each of the cloud providers has a handful of closed source databases, so that's a totally

1238
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:37,600
fine thing to do, but to try and say like, oh, we're open source and then change it,

1239
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,640
it's just like, I don't know, it's kind of ridiculous.

1240
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,320
Well Paul, fascinating stuff.

1241
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,680
Thanks for sharing your take with us.

1242
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:48,120
Definitely want to come and have you back once you've rolled out this new, what do you

1243
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,120
call it?

1244
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,120
Complimentary model.

1245
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,120
Yeah.

1246
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,520
You have some real world results to report back how it's going and if it's serving the

1247
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,880
needs of you and your users and the open source community the way that you hope it will, we'd

1248
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,040
love to have you back on the show.

1249
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,360
Yeah, I think that's just one closing thought on that really quick, which you reminded me

1250
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:10,640
of, which is like, I think for people to think about it can open, permissive open source

1251
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,920
licensing survive in infrastructure software?

1252
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:17,480
I totally think it can, but I think the people who are producing it have to think ahead of

1253
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:22,360
time about how they commercialize it over the long run.

1254
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:30,400
And for us with Iox, I've already defined what success looks like is tons of competitors,

1255
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:34,440
literally cloud providers adopting the software and competing with us.

1256
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,440
So what that, which isn't going to happen for years, best case scenario, right, if it

1257
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,440
happens at all.

1258
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:44,880
But what that means is we're developing a commercial product side by side with the open

1259
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,420
product right now so that if cloud providers decide they want to get in on the game three

1260
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:57,080
years from now, we've already had plenty of time to actually build a product to compete.

1261
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,680
Stay tuned for results as they come out.

1262
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,680
Thanks, Paul.

1263
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,680
We really appreciate you coming on the show.

1264
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,680
All right.

1265
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,680
Thanks, guys.

1266
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,240
Next, we're talking with Vicky Bressour.

1267
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,840
Vicky has been in free and open source software for 30 years now, and she's been working with

1268
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,780
startups and enterprises doing open source and free software business strategy for quite

1269
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:16,780
a while.

1270
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:22,400
We use Vicky's post titled Elastic Search and Kibana are now business risks as a reference

1271
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,640
on the situation.

1272
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,840
We even quoted her post a few times in our conversation with Heather Meeker.

1273
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,720
So naturally, we had a talk with her.

1274
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,720
Here we go.

1275
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,720
All right.

1276
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:31,720
So here is Vicky Bressour.

1277
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:37,320
And Vicky, share with us, first of all, your position in the open source world, like what's

1278
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,920
your angle at the conversation that we're having?

1279
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,920
Where are you coming from?

1280
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,400
I do corporate strategy around free and open source software.

1281
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,520
So I work with startups and enterprises and various organizations to help them be more

1282
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,440
successful by contributing, releasing and just generally becoming a good citizen of

1283
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,280
free and open source software communities in a way that's both good for their bottom

1284
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,480
line and for the communities.

1285
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:00,480
Okay.

1286
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,800
And you've been doing this for a while.

1287
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,800
Yeah, I have.

1288
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,860
I've been in free and open source software for over 30 years and I've been doing this

1289
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:08,960
specific thing for quite a while now.

1290
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,960
Awesome.

1291
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,880
Well, we're glad we got you on the show then.

1292
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:17,080
So you wrote a piece called Elastic Search and Kibana Are Now Business Risks, in which

1293
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,680
you lay out the case for that headline.

1294
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,880
Do you want to share that with our audience?

1295
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,440
Just the brief synopsis of why you believe that's the case with this server-side public

1296
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,440
license?

1297
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,880
Well, I mean, SSPL, I'm going to leave to the lawyers.

1298
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,560
This is a legal matter, but it is not an open source license.

1299
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:37,680
It is, however, being portrayed as open, which everybody is going to interpret as open source

1300
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,600
because that's just the way we speak about things.

1301
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,920
So I think that in and of itself is kind of deceptive and that's a problem.

1302
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,720
But the bigger problem is that this is a license change.

1303
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:52,720
And if you are going to use something, you are agreeing to that license.

1304
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:59,920
If you upgrade Elastic Search or Kibana to, I believe it was 7.11, if I recall, but if

1305
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,520
you upgrade, you are tacitly or otherwise you are agreeing to this new license, SSPL

1306
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,200
or Elastic License, it doesn't matter.

1307
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,960
You're agreeing to that and you're taking on new obligations for your company, for your

1308
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:13,960
organization.

1309
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,960
Are you aware of that?

1310
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,240
Do you know what you're taking on?

1311
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:21,440
Do you know the potential risks you might have or maybe there are benefits?

1312
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,240
I don't know.

1313
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:28,720
But this is not something that you as a company can afford to ignore because it can have huge

1314
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,040
ramifications to your code base.

1315
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,040
I see.

1316
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,320
So like the side swipe is a big problem.

1317
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:39,320
The fact that so many people might upgrade and unbeknownst to them, their agreement with

1318
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:44,440
the software that they're running and the companies involved has changed.

1319
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,040
Is there no transparency to that change?

1320
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,360
Is it not something that people are aware of or how does it play out?

1321
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:54,440
The only transparency really is going to be that blog post or I guess there's like two

1322
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:02,440
blog posts now with Elastic finger wagging at Amazon and also screwing over their entire

1323
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,280
community and ecosystem.

1324
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,800
But hey, that's their strategic decision to make.

1325
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,120
They seem to think that was the right move for them, more power to them.

1326
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,400
Yeah, that's really the only warning.

1327
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,360
You're otherwise not going to know.

1328
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:21,120
As far as I know, I haven't obviously looked at the code, but it doesn't make any sense

1329
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:28,100
that there be some sort of a new click through on Elasticsearch and Kibana, for instance.

1330
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,680
As you're installing them on your server, how are you going to confirm that?

1331
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,880
Yes, I have seen that there is a new license and yes, I agree with this new license.

1332
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:40,760
Nobody does that, not for open source software and especially not on the server side.

1333
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:45,600
So it's very likely people are going to upgrade and tacitly agree to this, whether they know

1334
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,880
it or not, or maybe they know about this new license and that they decide not to upgrade

1335
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,880
at all.

1336
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:58,400
Well, now you're not getting security updates to this software, to Elasticsearch, to Kibana.

1337
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,580
That's another potential risk to your company.

1338
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:06,520
Maybe you're using these things for free and a great deal of people build a lot of cool

1339
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,580
stuff on top of the ELK stack.

1340
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:14,440
There's a reason why there's an acronym that we all know, the ELK stack, it is that popular.

1341
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:18,120
So a lot of people are building on this and they might be building on the free version.

1342
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,720
Well, that free version is not going to get relicensed and you're going to be screwed,

1343
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,280
but if you are building a company on top of this open source software and your company

1344
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:31,740
relies upon it and you're not already paying for some sort of support, either from Elastic

1345
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:35,600
or someone else, you're also putting your company at risk in that way.

1346
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,960
So there's a lot of really important strategic things that people need to be considering

1347
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,280
when they are selecting open source software and you need to remain aware of your entire

1348
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,720
free and open source software supply chain, because as we are seeing right here, it can

1349
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,760
shift out from under you.

1350
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:57,400
You can have license changes, you can have security problems, you can have maintainers

1351
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,460
who just, you know, piece out and they go away and suddenly you're using something that's

1352
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,460
completely unmaintained.

1353
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,560
So there's a lot of risk there for a company and most companies I've worked with are completely

1354
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,000
unaware of this and it's potentially a disaster waiting to happen.

1355
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:22,600
I mean, as we all know, this is what happened with, oh, that credit reporting thing starts

1356
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,560
with an E. Equifax, Equifax.

1357
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,560
Thank you.

1358
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,040
Now, I've been saying Elastic so often, that's all I can think of.

1359
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:31,040
That's the only E in your brain.

1360
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,040
We're here for you.

1361
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,040
Exactly.

1362
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,040
Thank you, guys.

1363
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:38,600
Yeah, that was, Equifax was not paying attention to their open source software supply chain.

1364
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:42,800
You know, they had a piece of software in there, I believe it may have been Apache Struts

1365
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:48,160
or something like that, that had been upgraded to fix a security hole, but they hadn't bothered

1366
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:52,800
to upgrade it internally because they weren't paying that much attention then they got compromised

1367
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,840
and billions of people had their private information stolen.

1368
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,620
So if you're not paying attention to stuff like this, not only Elastic, but the larger

1369
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:04,800
picture, you are just one bad day away from being the next Equifax.

1370
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,000
Do you want to do that?

1371
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,640
Is there a right way that Elastic could have done this in terms of just forget the decision,

1372
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,920
the SSPL, but like, let's say I just want to change my license.

1373
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,000
Is there like a correct, do you have to start a new project with a new license?

1374
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,780
Is there like a best practices for changing a license that doesn't sweep out the rug from

1375
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:26,760
people potentially?

1376
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:32,000
For an open source project, there's obviously many different ways you can do it and Elastic

1377
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,640
has their perspective, which is going to come from a very corporate perspective.

1378
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:41,160
We're looking to make money and then the community will be coming from a different perspective.

1379
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:46,080
So it, you can have different approaches, but the one thing everyone should always do

1380
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,280
is be communicating with their community and their ecosystem.

1381
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:56,120
This caught everyone by surprise that shows that Elastic is not respecting the community

1382
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:00,920
and the people who have been contributing and who rely on this software.

1383
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:05,920
So they have essentially looked at their ecosystem and said, yeah, we don't care.

1384
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:12,480
We don't care what you're doing because all we want to do is screw over Amazon and collateral

1385
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,120
damage be damned.

1386
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,120
So they should have communicated.

1387
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,200
They should have told people this is going to be coming.

1388
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:24,200
Maybe they should have done it for instance, at a version 8.0 rather than version from

1389
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,200
7.10 to 7.11.

1390
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,200
Yeah.

1391
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,200
Go to a major version.

1392
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,360
Maybe that would have been smarter.

1393
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:34,440
Maybe cut a major version right there.

1394
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,980
Just do that.

1395
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:42,920
Maybe you could have forked it internally and start developing internally and then leave

1396
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,400
the open source project alone for other people to build upon.

1397
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,720
And you can even, you know, push stuff upstream and pull stuff downstream.

1398
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:58,440
You can still benefit from that while having your proprietary internally developed software.

1399
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,440
You can still do that.

1400
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,080
I mean, there's lots of different options they could have done, but the one thing they

1401
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:08,900
should have done and did not was communicate with their ecosystem, with their community.

1402
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:12,700
They popped this on everyone and it was kind of rude.

1403
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:18,120
They violated the trust of their community and that you can't really get that back at

1404
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,220
this point.

1405
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:25,000
So you kind of screwed the trust of your community and you've besmirched your brand, which is

1406
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,640
going to be incredibly difficult to fix.

1407
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:32,040
It's a somewhat too elastic credit and maybe I'm wrong by even saying this, but it seems

1408
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,800
that they've gone through a lot.

1409
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:38,640
When Shay had mentioned, the CTO of Elastic mentioned the litigation and the behind the

1410
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:44,480
scenes discussions, I think from the outside it might be easy to say screwed over.

1411
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,760
But the nuance there, I think, is they've gone through a lot and maybe they're in some

1412
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:53,640
ways quite wrong and reactionary, but I'd say in some ways at least depicted by these

1413
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:59,660
tweets and this post, maybe they went about it wrong, but their intention was to try to

1414
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:04,420
fix this problem, which is very difficult to fix because our permissive license does

1415
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:09,600
allow this competition and maybe from a business standpoint, they've sort of hit their links

1416
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:15,660
with being able to take that, in quotes, their quotes at least, abuse from Amazon and they're

1417
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:22,160
just trying to tread water to some degree with the scenario.

1418
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:26,120
I know that this is a podcast and so people can't see me, but picture me rolling my eyes

1419
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,120
right now.

1420
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:32,720
So the trademark thing aside, that's a different matter.

1421
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,040
That lawsuit for the trademark is a separate issue.

1422
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:43,360
If they are re-licensing as a reaction to that, then it's essentially them stamping

1423
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,080
their little princess foot, taking their ball and going home.

1424
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:55,280
And it's a childish reaction to a trademark infringement lawsuit, which I do think that

1425
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,840
they are, I mean, they were totally justified in that lawsuit for their trademark infringement

1426
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,840
against the Amazon.

1427
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,080
I have absolutely no problem with that.

1428
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:07,880
I do think that Amazon was rolling the dice on that one and they lost.

1429
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:12,560
And I think they will lose in that particular trademark thing, but I am not a lawyer.

1430
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,840
So that's just my, my education.

1431
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,840
Right.

1432
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,480
That's just your take.

1433
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:26,040
So but the re-licensing, you know, if they screwed up at the very beginning by not understanding

1434
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:31,760
what a permissive license allows and what that is, they screwed that up.

1435
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:37,360
They put it out there under a permissive Apache 2 license without thinking somebody can now

1436
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,200
build a better product offering on top of this very easily.

1437
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:47,040
And if they're building a better product offering than we are, I'm sorry, folks, we live in

1438
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,600
a capitalistic system.

1439
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,140
That's just the way these things go.

1440
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:57,120
It's your fault for releasing your intellectual property under that sort of license and not

1441
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,720
understanding what it's going to mean.

1442
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:06,240
And if you did understand not taking enough measures to make sure that even if that does

1443
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,280
happen, you can still be successful.

1444
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:12,080
And frankly, if you look at their numbers and their financials, they are doing quite

1445
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,180
well.

1446
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,820
So what are they looking to do?

1447
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:20,720
How are they going to looking to grab all these people who are using the Amazon ecosystem

1448
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,880
and move them over to Elasticsearch and to Elastic?

1449
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:27,920
I don't think that's going to happen from a market perspective.

1450
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:33,400
So I it's very difficult to see strategically why they thought this might have been a good

1451
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:39,840
move to just give their entire ecosystem the finger while trying to take a shot at Amazon.

1452
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,760
It just it kind of seems, I don't know, amateurish.

1453
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,480
And I would have expected better of a company that's been around for this long.

1454
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:51,640
So let's say I was a happy Elasticsearch user a month ago.

1455
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:52,640
And here I am today.

1456
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,520
And I'm like, Vicky, what do I do?

1457
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,040
They change the license on me.

1458
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,040
I don't know what to do.

1459
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,680
Do you say what do you say to that?

1460
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:03,320
Go to the Amazon fork or I will say, I don't know.

1461
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,320
It depends.

1462
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,560
Of course, I'm I have been known to do a fair bit of consulting.

1463
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:13,920
And so any consultant who isn't starting out with it depends is, you know, trying to sell

1464
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:14,920
you something.

1465
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,920
Right.

1466
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:16,920
So it totally depends.

1467
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:17,920
What are your needs?

1468
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,960
How much do you rely on that Elasticsearch or on that Kibana?

1469
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:25,420
We have to remember there are two really big projects here that have been re licensed.

1470
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:27,480
It's not just Elasticsearch.

1471
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:34,600
So what is the strategic value and the architectural value of that piece of software to your product,

1472
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,600
to your company?

1473
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,480
Look at that first.

1474
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,240
What is the niche it is filling?

1475
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,300
And then will anything else fill it?

1476
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:45,640
And it could be that as you evaluate this and you look at it, it makes sense to just

1477
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,320
pay Elastic for their software.

1478
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,320
Fine.

1479
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,320
That is a valid choice.

1480
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,120
And I support you doing that.

1481
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:57,520
I want your company to be successful, but you might also find that there are other alternatives.

1482
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,520
You might.

1483
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:03,840
There are a couple of forts now there is, as we all know, the, the thing that kicked

1484
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,960
all this off, which is Amazon's open distribution for Elasticsearch from the last time Elasticsearch

1485
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:13,320
did something kind of goofy in their open source world.

1486
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:19,840
And then there's, they have their new totally open distribution that Amazon just forked.

1487
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:25,600
And I think there's a third one, which is from log.io, something like that.

1488
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,880
There's at least one other version out there.

1489
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,280
There may be others.

1490
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,840
And maybe you don't need Elasticsearch at all.

1491
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:37,840
Maybe you just need Lucene, you know, if you're using Kibana, yeah, exactly.

1492
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,240
Maybe Grafana would be better for you.

1493
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,240
I don't know.

1494
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,560
It depends upon your needs.

1495
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,000
Don't go doing something just because it's what everyone else is doing.

1496
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,360
Look at your needs, your company, your architecture, your budgets, your staffing, who knows what

1497
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:55,280
software do you have to ramp up on something new?

1498
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,280
There's lots of variables in there.

1499
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,120
And so I can't give a one size fits all answer.

1500
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,320
I was hoping I could just ask you once and the whole community could just listen to you,

1501
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,960
you know, let's multicast the solution.

1502
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,960
Oh no.

1503
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,600
You know, there is no single solution to any of this sort of stuff because every one of

1504
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,680
these companies is going to be different.

1505
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:15,640
If they were all the same, then we wouldn't need them all, right?

1506
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:20,520
We we'd have one market, one company, boom, you're done, but we don't have one license,

1507
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,520
one license.

1508
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:22,880
Gosh, wouldn't that be?

1509
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,160
Oh my gosh, that would be so easy.

1510
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,160
So nice.

1511
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,160
But that's what we do.

1512
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,760
We wouldn't need a consultant at that point.

1513
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,920
Well, yeah, but I do corporate strategy.

1514
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,400
It's not simply about licensing.

1515
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,200
It's about so much more than that.

1516
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,200
That's just a tiny slipper.

1517
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,120
Well, Vicki, we want to respect your time.

1518
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,080
Is there anything else that you want to share that we didn't ask you?

1519
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:42,160
Any questions that you just want to put this out there that we haven't asked you a question

1520
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,160
to at least?

1521
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,160
No, not really.

1522
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,640
I think you've covered pretty much the highlights of the stuff and then it'll be interesting

1523
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,320
to see what others have to say.

1524
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:55,120
I don't typically listen to podcasts, but maybe I'll actually listen to this one.

1525
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:59,480
Well, you might hear me thank you at least once before I thank you right now for your

1526
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,480
time.

1527
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,440
But thank you really for your time and for this blog post that you shared.

1528
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:08,400
It was very helpful for us to sort of get a different perspective on these concerns

1529
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,400
around open source.

1530
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,840
I quoted a couple of things you'd mentioned in your blog post in the conversation with

1531
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,920
Heather Meeker, which is a part of the show too.

1532
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,200
But thank you for your post and also today.

1533
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,200
Thank you for your time.

1534
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,200
We appreciate it.

1535
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,200
Absolutely.

1536
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,260
Thanks, gang.

1537
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:30,700
Last up on this epic show is Markus Stinkvist, who self-describes as an everyday web developer

1538
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,700
from Sweden.

1539
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,700
Let's do this.

1540
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,360
Markus, please tell us who you are and your vantage point on the software world.

1541
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,360
Yeah.

1542
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:42,560
Well, I'm just a normal everyday web developer from Sweden.

1543
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,860
My name is Markus.

1544
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,240
So I work for a small company no one has heard of yet.

1545
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,240
Yet.

1546
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,240
There you go.

1547
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,560
Yeah, exactly.

1548
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,440
How did you first hear about the news of Elastic's re-licensing?

1549
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,480
Just curious, like where do you get your info?

1550
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,480
Yeah.

1551
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:03,800
Well, I read an article from Elastic on Hacker News.

1552
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:09,240
So I saw them posting like, this is not okay or something in those lines.

1553
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,240
Awesome.

1554
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,920
Well, we're gathering perspectives from all over the community.

1555
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,940
So it's awesome to have just a regular everyday web developer here on the show.

1556
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:17,940
So welcome.

1557
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,380
And yeah, what do you think?

1558
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,720
What are your thoughts on the whole situation?

1559
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,440
There's lots of nuance, lots of ins, lots of outs.

1560
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,440
Yeah, exactly.

1561
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:25,440
Exactly.

1562
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:32,400
I read a lot of comments and I read the Amazon article as well when they posted about like

1563
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:37,320
forking the report after they re-licensed Elastic.

1564
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:43,320
And I really don't even use Elastic or Amazon web services that much.

1565
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:48,400
But I think I care a lot about open source in general.

1566
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,640
So I'm with you.

1567
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,760
I don't use AWS.

1568
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,760
I don't use Elastic.

1569
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,260
I also care a lot about open source.

1570
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:57,640
What is it about open source that you like or that you care about and are trying to preserve

1571
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,400
or be a part of?

1572
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,400
That's a good question.

1573
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:08,560
I think it's a matter of fact that I can use stuff for free and like share with colleagues

1574
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,900
and people all around the world without any restrictions.

1575
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:18,260
No one is like can forbid me from using stuff which I want to use.

1576
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:23,760
So when you first heard about the re-license to the SSPL, what was your hot take?

1577
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,680
What was your emotional reaction?

1578
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,600
Were you indifferent?

1579
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,600
Were you mad at Elastic?

1580
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,100
Did it feel like it's no longer open source or do you still think it's still in the spirit

1581
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:34,000
of open source?

1582
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,840
Well, I think I'm actually very much on the Elastic side for me.

1583
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:46,280
I saw a lot of comments on hacking news that were like, oh, Amazon is all in their rights

1584
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,880
and yada yada.

1585
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:55,720
But they have actually done the same with MongoDB like two years ago, I guess, where

1586
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:06,840
they pushed them to basically re-license because they simply don't want to pay their fees.

1587
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:16,200
I think Amazon could be a bit more friendly towards those open source companies because

1588
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:22,440
right now when they just use their products for free and maybe they hurt the possibilities

1589
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,960
of future open source companies going forward.

1590
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,800
So if you were an Elastic user, Elasticsearch user?

1591
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,720
Yeah, I have been in the past.

1592
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:31,720
You have been.

1593
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:35,440
But if you were today, like when you read the re-license, you would have been pro-Elastic.

1594
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:41,640
This would not have concerned you or offended you or changed the way you looked at Elasticsearch.

1595
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:47,280
Well, I think it's sad that they have to do it, that they have to re-license, that they

1596
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,760
feel like they need to.

1597
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:57,000
And that's what makes me think that their move is kind of OK in a way, because I will

1598
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:03,040
still support them and I would rather use them than the fork created by Amazon.

1599
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:09,980
So the fork still exists under the new fork, which is created by Amazon and trying to carry

1600
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:11,920
on from that point forward.

1601
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,160
I think it still exists under the previous license.

1602
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:20,980
But you would continue with Elastic versus the Elasticsearch and Kibana forks that are

1603
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:23,040
run by AWS now.

1604
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,040
Exactly.

1605
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:30,200
And that's simply because I believe in their vision or I believe in their product.

1606
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:35,560
And I think Amazon is going to have a hard time keeping up or maybe they won't.

1607
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,560
I'm not sure.

1608
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,560
But time will tell on that.

1609
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:45,040
Time will tell, of course, but the same goes with MongoDB and their DocumentDB, I guess.

1610
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:51,640
I still think MongoDB is a superior choice just because it's their project and their

1611
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,880
vision.

1612
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,960
So you're not an open source purist then?

1613
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,960
Not at all.

1614
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:57,960
Not at all.

1615
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:58,960
Not at all.

1616
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:59,960
No.

1617
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:00,960
More pragmatic.

1618
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,960
More about free and open and available.

1619
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:05,240
Have you thought about any of the other licenses like the source available licenses?

1620
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,420
Are you cool with that?

1621
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:09,920
And these other things like business source licensing, surely these are things that you've

1622
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,080
read about being in the open source world.

1623
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,560
Are these things that you're also just like, whatever you want to license your code as,

1624
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:20,160
if I can use it for free and contribute back somehow, it's cool?

1625
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,880
Yeah, I think it's cool.

1626
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,740
Like every license is their own choice.

1627
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:30,460
If you want to license your work in a certain way, it's your choice.

1628
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:36,840
And if you want to share your work with others, that's just a positive thing.

1629
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:43,680
And I feel in this case, like Amazon is hurting the possibility to do that.

1630
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:44,680
Awesome.

1631
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,680
Any other thoughts?

1632
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:54,840
No, I think people that are on like Amazon side should maybe read an article from Frederik

1633
01:44:54,840 --> 01:45:03,480
Larney or something like that, which is like on TechCrunch called AVS gives open source

1634
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:04,480
to middle finger.

1635
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:10,320
I think that's an article that sums up my views pretty well.

1636
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,320
Awesome.

1637
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:13,920
Hand that off to me and we'll include it in the show notes for everybody.

1638
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:14,920
Yeah, sure.

1639
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:17,080

1640
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,080

All right.

1642
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:21,720
